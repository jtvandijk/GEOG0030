## Welcome {.unnumbered}
Welcome to **Geocomputation**. This module offers a deep dive into the principles of spatial analysis while providing a thorough introduction to reproducible research. Over the next ten weeks, you will explore the theory, methods, and tools of spatial analysis through engaging case studies. You will gain hands-on experience in sourcing, managing, and cleaning spatial, demographic, and socioeconomic datasets, and apply core spatial analysis techniques to interpret them.

## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}
Please be aware that for this module you are expected to have access to a working **R v4.4** installation and have a basic level of proficiency in programming with R. This includes skills such as installing libraries, loading data, calculating variables, and reshaping data. For installation instructions and a refresher, please refer to the *Getting started* and *R for Data Analysis* tutorials in the [GEOG0018: Methods in Human Geography](https://jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0018/00-index.html) workbook.

## Moodle {.unnumbered}
[Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/) serves as the central hub for GEOG0030, where you will find all essential module information, including key details about assessments. This workbook provides links to all required reading materials and contains the content for each computer tutorial.
