## Welcome {.unnumbered}
Welcome to **Geocomputation**. This module will introduce you both to the principles of spatial analysis as well as provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the use of programming. Over the next ten weeks, you will learn about the theory, methods and tools of spatial analysis through relevant case studies. You will learn how to find, manage and clean spatial, demographic and socioeconomic datasets, and then analyse them using core spatial analysis techniques. 

## Moodle {.unnumbered}
[Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/) is the central point of contact for GEOG0030 and it is where all important information will be communicated such as key module and assessment information. This workbook contains links to all reading material as well as the contents for all computer tutorials

## Module overview {.unnumbered}

## Troubleshooting {.unnumbered}
Spatial analysis can yield fascinating insights into geographical relationships, albeit at times it can be challenging, particularly when we combine this with learning how to program at the same time. You will most likely encounter error messages, experience software crashes, and spend time to identify bugs in your code. However, the rewards of learning how to programmatically solve complex spatial problems will be very much worth it in the end.

If you need specific assistance with this module, please:

- Ask a question at the end of a lecture or during the computer practicals.
- Check the [Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/) assessment tab for queries relating to this module's assessment.
- Attend the scheduled Geocomputation **Additional Support Hours**.
- Book a slot in our [Academic Support and Feedback hours](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/8561a481703d4feda7a704ab81b62c8d@ucl.ac.uk?anonymous&ep=plink).
