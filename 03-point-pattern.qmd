# Point Pattern Analysis
This week, we will be focusing on Point Pattern Analysis, which aims to detect clusters or patterns within a set of points. Through this analysis, we can measure density, dispersion, and homogeneity in point structures. Various methods exist for calculating and identifying these clusters, and today we will explore several of these techniques using our [bike theft dataset from last week](02-operations.html).

## Before you leave
As geographers we are keen to understand our point data's distribution and understand whether are our points clustered, randomly distributed, uniform or dispersed. We have looked at various techniques that enable us to statistically and visually assess our data's distribution and understand whether our data is randomly distributed or clustered in space. And that is [us done for this week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zxtbwGogyY). Reading list anyone?
