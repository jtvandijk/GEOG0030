This list is not exhaustive but includes some recommended websites to get you started.\n\n\nThe following websites contain Open Data or link to Open Data from several respectable data providers:\n\nAfricanUrbanNetwork\nAirBnB Data\nBike Docking Data (ready for R)\nBing Maps worldwide road detections\nCamden Air Action\nConsumer Data Research Centre\nDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\nEdina (e.g. OS mastermap)\nEU Tourism Data\nEurostat\nGeofabrik (OSM data)\nGeolytix Supermarket Retail Points\nGlobal Urban Areas dataset\nGlobal Weather Data\nGoogle Dataset Search\nGoogle Open Buildings\nKaggle Public Datasets\nKing’s College Data on Air Pollution\nLondon Data Store\nLondon Local Authority Maintained Trees\nLondon Tube PM2.5 Levels\nMicrosoft Global Building Footprints\nMicrosoft Research Open Data\nNational Public Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN)\nNASA EARTHDATA\nNASA SocioEconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)\nNHS Data (ready for R)\nnomis Official Census and Labour Market Statistics\nOffice for National Statistics Geoportal\nOffice for National Statistics\nOpen Topography\nOverture Point of Interest data for the United Kingdom\nPlanetary Computer Data Catalog\npseudo Census Output Areas 2001-2011-2021\nPublic transport accessibility indicators Great Britain\nTesco Store Data (London)\nTfL Cycling Data\nTfL Open Data\nTidy Tuesday Data (not exclusively spatial data)\nUK Data Service\nUS Census Data\nUS City Open Data Census\nUSGS Earth Explorer\nUTD19 Multi-City Traffic Dataset\nWorldPop GitHub\nWorldPop\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate students can also apply for Safeguarded datasets held by the Consumer Data Research Centre. Accessing these datasets requires following a specific process, which is outlined on the CDRC website. When applying, you will need to explain why you require the specific dataset and describe how you intend to use it. Additionally, consider the ethical implications of using the data, as this will be an important part of your application. Please be aware that it normally takes 4-5 weeks for your application to be processed.\nSome of the datasets held by the CDRC that you can apply for are:\n\nBicycle Sharing System Docking Station Observations\nCDRC Modelled Ethnicity Proportions - LSOA Geography\nFCA Financial Lives Survey\nSpeedchecker Broadband Internet Speed Tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the application process for Safeguarded CDRC datasets can take several weeks, these datasets may be more suitable for your undergraduate dissertation rather than the GEOG0030 coursework assignment. However, CDRC datasets labeled as Open Data do not require an application process. You can download these datasets directly after registering on the website."
