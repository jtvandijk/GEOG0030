    "text": "This week we will turn to geodemographic classification. Geodemographic classification is a method used to categorise geographic areas and the people living in them based on demographic, socioeconomic, and sometimes lifestyle characteristics. This approach combines geographic information with demographic data to create profiles of different neighborhoods.\n\n\nYou can download the slides of this week’s lecture here: [Link].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDalton, C.

Specifically, we will try to identify clusters based on age group, self-identified ethnicity, country of birth, and first or preferred language.\nThe data covers all usual residents, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level. These datasets have been extracted using the Custom Dataset Tool, and you can download each file via the links provided below. A copy of the 2021 London LSOAs spatial boundaries is also available. Save these files in your project folder under data.\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Age Groups\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Country of Birth\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Ethnicity\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Main Language\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have already downloaded some of these datasets in previous weeks, but for completeness, they are all provided here.

To do this we first need to prepare the individual datasets, as well as transform and standardise the input variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(k\\)-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into a predefined number of clusters, based on similarities between data points. It works by initially assigning \\(k\\) random centroids, then iteratively updating them by assigning each data point to the nearest centroid and recalculating the centroid’s position based on the mean of the points in each cluster. The process continues until the centroids stabilise, meaning they no longer change significantly. \\(k\\)-means is often used for tasks such as data segmentation, image compression, or anomaly detection. It is simple but may not work well with non-spherical or overlapping clusters.\n\n\n\nBecause all the data are stored in long format, with each London LSOA appearing on multiple rows for each category — such as separate rows for different age groups, ethnicities, countries of birth, and first or preferred languages - we need to transform it into a wide format. For example, instead of having multiple rows for an LSOA showing counts for different age groups all the information for each LSOA will be consolidated into a single row. Additionally, we will clean up the column names to follow standard R naming conventions and make the data easier to work with. Like we have done previously, we can automate this process using the janitor package.\nWe will begin with the age dataframe:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# clean names\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# pivot\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"age_5_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\")\n\n# clean names\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your clean_names() function returns an error, it is likely due to a conflict with another library that also includes a clean_names() function. In such cases, R cannot determine which one to use. To resolve this, you can specify the library explicitly by using janitor::clean_names().\n\n\n\nTo account for the non-uniformity of the areal units, we further need to convert the observations to proportions and only retain those columns that are likely to be meaningful in the context of the classification:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# total observations\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(age_pop = sum(across(2:6)))\n\n# total proportions, select columns\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:6, ~./age_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(1:6)\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa_age)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n# Rowwise: \n  lower_layer_super_output_areas_code aged_15_years_and_un…¹ aged_16_to_24_years\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E01000001                                           0.0846              0.0744\n2 E01000002                                           0.0621              0.0889\n3 E01000003                                           0.0682              0.0706\n4 E01000005                                           0.127               0.178 \n5 E01000006                                           0.224               0.120 \n6 E01000007                                           0.257               0.103 \n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​aged_15_years_and_under\n# ℹ 3 more variables: aged_25_to_34_years &lt;dbl&gt;, aged_35_to_49_years &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   aged_50_years_and_over &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThis looks much better. We can do the same for the country of birth data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# prepare country of birth data\nlsoa_cob &lt;- lsoa_cob |&gt;\n    clean_names() |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"country_of_birth_8_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\") |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# proportions, select columns\nlsoa_cob &lt;- lsoa_cob |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(cob_pop = sum(across(2:9))) |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:9, ~./cob_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(-2, -10)\n\n\nAnd we can do the same for the ethnicity and language datasets:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# prepare ethnicity data\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    clean_names() |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"ethnic_group_20_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\") |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# proportions, select columns\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(eth_pop = sum(across(2:21))) |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:21, ~./eth_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(-2, -22)\n\n# prepare language data\nlsoa_lan &lt;- lsoa_lan |&gt;\n    clean_names() |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"main_language_11_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\") |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# proportions, select columns\nlsoa_lan &lt;- lsoa_lan |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(lan_pop = sum(across(2:12))) |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:12, ~./lan_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(-2, -11, -13)\n\n\nWe now have four separate datasets, each containing the proportions of usual residents classified into different groups based on age, country of birth, ethnicity, and language.\n\n\n\nWhere we initially selected variables from different demographic domains, not all variables may be suitable for inclusion. Firstly, the variables need to exhibit sufficient heterogeneity to ensure they capture meaningful differences between observations. Secondly, variables should not be highly correlated with one another, as this redundancy can skew the clustering results. Ensuring acceptable correlation between variables helps maintain the diversity of information and improves the robustness of the clustering outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable selection is often a time-consuming process that requires a combination of domain knowledge and more extensive exploratory analysis than is covered in this practical.\n\n\n\nA straightforward yet effective method to examine the distribution of our variables is to create boxplots for each variable. This can be efficiently achieved by using facet_wrap() from the ggplot2 library to generate a matrix of panels, allowing us to visualise all variables in a single view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a popular data visualisation package in R, designed for creating complex plots. It uses the Grammar of Graphics to build layered, customisable graphics by mapping data to visual elements like colour, size, and shape. We will explore the ggplot2 library further in Weeks 9 and 10. In the meantime, you can refer to the ggplot2 documentation for more details on facet_wrap().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# wide to long\nlsoa_age_wd &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(cols = c(2:5), names_to = \"agegroup\", values_to = \"count\")\n\n# facet age\nggplot(lsoa_age_wd, aes(y = count)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~agegroup, ncol = 2) +\n    theme_minimal() + ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Boxplots of the distribution of the age dataset.\n\n\n\n\nWhen repeating this process for the birth, ethnicity, and language variables, you will notice that some variables have a very limited distribution. Specifically, some variables may have a value of 0 for the majority of London LSOAs. As a rule of thumb, we will retain only those variables where at least 75% of the LSOAs have values different from 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis threshold of 75% is arbitrary, and in practice, more thorough consideration should be given when deciding whether to include or exclude a variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join\nlsoa_df &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    left_join(lsoa_cob, by = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\") |&gt;\n    left_join(lsoa_eth, by = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\") |&gt;\n    left_join(lsoa_lan, by = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\")\n\n# calculate proportion of zeroes\nzero_prop &lt;- sapply(lsoa_df[2:41], function(x) {\n    mean(x == 0)\n})\n\n# extract variables with high proportion zeroes\nidx &lt;- which(zero_prop &gt; 0.25)\n\n# inspect\nidx\n\n\n   white_gypsy_or_irish_traveller            any_other_uk_languages \n                               27                                33 \n  oceanic_or_australian_languages north_or_south_american_languages \n                               37                                38 \n\n# remove variables with high proportion zeroes\nlsoa_df &lt;- lsoa_df |&gt;\n    select(-white_gypsy_or_irish_traveller, -any_other_uk_languages, -oceanic_or_australian_languages,\n        -north_or_south_american_languages)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code above makes use of Boolean logic to calculate the proportion of zeroes within each variable. The x == 0 part checks each value in column x to see if it is equal to 0, returning TRUE or FALSE for each element. The mean() function is then used to calculate the average of the TRUE values in the column. Since TRUE is treated as 1 and FALSE as 0, this gives the proportion of values in the column that are equal to zero.\n\n\n\nWe can subsequently check for multicollinearity of the remaining variables. The easiest way to check the correlations between all variables is probably by visualising a correlation matrix:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect variable names\nnames(lsoa_df)\n\n\n [1] \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\"                                  \n [2] \"aged_15_years_and_under\"                                              \n [3] \"aged_16_to_24_years\"                                                  \n [4] \"aged_25_to_34_years\"                                                  \n [5] \"aged_35_to_49_years\"                                                  \n [6] \"aged_50_years_and_over\"                                               \n [7] \"europe_united_kingdom\"                                                \n [8] \"europe_ireland\"                                                       \n [9] \"europe_other_europe\"                                                  \n[10] \"africa\"                                                               \n[11] \"middle_east_and_asia\"                                                 \n[12] \"the_americas_and_the_caribbean\"                                       \n[13] \"antarctica_and_oceania_including_australasia_and_other\"               \n[14] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_bangladeshi\"                       \n[15] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_chinese\"                           \n[16] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_indian\"                            \n[17] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_pakistani\"                         \n[18] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_other_asian\"                       \n[19] \"black_black_british_black_welsh_caribbean_or_african_african\"         \n[20] \"black_black_british_black_welsh_caribbean_or_african_caribbean\"       \n[21] \"black_black_british_black_welsh_caribbean_or_african_other_black\"     \n[22] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_white_and_asian\"                      \n[23] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_white_and_black_african\"              \n[24] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_white_and_black_caribbean\"            \n[25] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_other_mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups\"\n[26] \"white_english_welsh_scottish_northern_irish_or_british\"               \n[27] \"white_irish\"                                                          \n[28] \"white_roma\"                                                           \n[29] \"white_other_white\"                                                    \n[30] \"other_ethnic_group_arab\"                                              \n[31] \"other_ethnic_group_any_other_ethnic_group\"                            \n[32] \"english_or_welsh\"                                                     \n[33] \"european_languages_eu\"                                                \n[34] \"other_european_languages_non_eu\"                                      \n[35] \"asian_languages\"                                                      \n[36] \"african_languages\"                                                    \n[37] \"any_other_languages\"                                                  \n\n# change variable names to index to improve visualisation\nlsoa_df_vis &lt;- lsoa_df\nnames(lsoa_df_vis)[2:37] &lt;- paste0(\"v\", sprintf(\"%02d\", 1:36))\n\n# correlation matrix\ncor_mat &lt;- cor(lsoa_df_vis[, -1])\n\n# correlation plot\nggcorrplot(cor_mat, outline.col = \"#ffffff\", tl.cex = 8, legend.title = \"Correlation\")\n\nWarning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.\nℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.\nℹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggcorrplot package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/kassambara/ggcorrplot/issues&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Correlation plot of classification variables.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the approach from Wyszomierski et al. (2024), we can define a weak correlation as lying between 0 and 0.40, moderate as between 0.41 and 0.65, strong as between 0.66 and 0.80, and very strong as between 0.81 and 1.\nA few strong and very strong correlations can be observed that potentially could be removed; however, to maintain representation, here we decide to retain all variables.\n\n\n\nIf the input data are heavily skewed or contain outliers, \\(k\\)-means may produce less meaningful clusters. While normality is not required per se, it has been common to do this nonetheless. More important is to standardise the input variables, especially when they are measured on different scales. This ensures that each variable contributes equally to the clustering process.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inverse hyperbolic sine\nlsoa_df_vis[, -1] &lt;- sapply(lsoa_df_vis[-1], asinh)\n\n# range standardise\nlsoa_df_vis[, -1] &lt;- sapply(lsoa_df_vis[-1], function(x) {\n    (x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))\n})\n\n\n\n\n\nNow our data are prepared we will start by creating an elbow plot. The elbow method is a visual tool that helps determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. This is important because with \\(k\\)-means clustering you need to specify the numbers of clusters a priori. The elbow method involves running the clustering algorithm with varying numbers of clusters (\\(k\\)) and plotting the total explained variation (known as the Within Sum of Squares) against the number of clusters. The goal is to identify the elbow point on the curve, where the rate of decrease in explained variation starts to slow. This point suggests that adding more clusters yields diminishing returns in terms of explained variation.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# elbow plot\nfviz_nbclust(lsoa_df_vis[, -1], kmeans, nstart = 100, iter.max = 100, method = \"wss\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Elbow plot with Within Sum of Squares against number of clusters.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the elbow plot, we can now choose the number of clusters and it looks like 6 clusters would be a reasonable choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretation of an elbow plot can be quite subjective, and multiple options for the optimal number of clusters might be justified; for instance, 4, 5, or even 7 clusters could be reasonable choices. In addition to the elbow method, other techniques can aid in determining the optimal number of clusters, such as silhouette scores and the gap statistic. An alternative and helful approach is to use a clustergram, which is a two-dimensional plot that visualises the flows of observations between clusters as more clusters are added. This method illustrates how your data reshuffles with each additional cluster and provides insights into the quality of the splits. This method can be done in R, but currently easier to implement in Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have decided on the number of clusters, we can run our \\(k\\)-means analysis.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(999)\n\n# k-means\nlsoa_clus &lt;- kmeans(lsoa_df_vis[, -1], centers = 6, nstart = 100, iter.max = 100)\n\n\nWe can inspect the object to get some information about our clusters:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\nlsoa_clus\n\n\nK-means clustering with 6 clusters of sizes 796, 1097, 771, 1011, 851, 468\n\nCluster means:\n        v01       v02       v03       v04       v05       v06       v07\n1 0.4816225 0.1632210 0.2425566 0.4838983 0.4169123 0.5410477 0.1337158\n        v08       v09       v10        v11        v12        v13        v14\n1 0.3007540 0.2480613 0.2859754 0.08913663 0.05177222 0.14603013 0.06993627\n         v15        v16        v17        v18        v19        v20        v21\n1 0.12176548 0.10935022 0.20109979 0.18150482 0.11605092 0.12757934 0.09288236\n         v22        v23       v24       v25       v26        v27       v28\n1 0.07473711 0.14662903 0.1842217 0.3522638 0.1490577 0.02997040 0.2423784\n         v29       v30       v31       v32        v33        v34        v35\n1 0.07148504 0.2193009 0.5870244 0.2411272 0.07541661 0.23467242 0.10174187\n         v36\n1 0.10216507\n [ reached 'max' / getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 5 rows ]\n\nClustering vector:\n [1] 4 4 4 1 1 5 5 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1\n[39] 1 1 1 1 5 1 5 1 1 1 1 1\n [ reached 'max' / getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 4944 entries ]\n\nWithin cluster sum of squares by cluster:\n[1] 259.0272 177.7951 288.8625 232.7770 298.9145 160.1702\n (between_SS / total_SS =  48.5 %)\n\nAvailable components:\n\n[1] \"cluster\"      \"centers\"      \"totss\"        \"withinss\"     \"tot.withinss\"\n[6] \"betweenss\"    \"size\"         \"iter\"         \"ifault\"      \n\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to perform some post-processing to extract useful summary data for each cluster. To characterise the clusters, we can compare the global mean values of each variable with the mean values specific to each cluster.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# global means\nglob_means &lt;- colMeans(lsoa_df_vis[, -1])\n\n# add clusters to input data\nlsoa_df_vis &lt;- cbind(lsoa_df_vis, cluster = lsoa_clus$cluster)\n\n# cluster means\ncluster_means &lt;- lsoa_df_vis |&gt;\n    group_by(cluster) |&gt;\n    summarise(across(2:37, mean))\n\n# difference\ncluster_diffs &lt;- cluster_means |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:37, ~. - glob_means[cur_column()]))\n\n\nThese comparisons can then be visualised using, for instance, a radial bar plot:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to long format\ncluster_diffs_long &lt;- cluster_diffs |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(!cluster, names_to = \"vars\", values_to = \"score\")\n\n# facet clusters\nggplot(cluster_diffs_long, aes(x = factor(vars), y = score)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    coord_radial(rotate.angle = TRUE, expand = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~cluster, ncol = 3) +\n    theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7)) + xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Radial barplots of cluster means for each input variable.\n\n\n\n\nThese plots can serve as a foundation for creating pen portraits by closely examining which variables drive each cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor easier interpretation, these values can be transformed into index scores, allowing us to assess which variables are under- or overrepresented within each cluster group.\n\n\n\nOf course, we can also map the results:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read spatial dataset\nlsoa21 &lt;- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n\n\nReading layer `London-LSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 4994 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n# join\nlsoa21 &lt;- cbind(lsoa21, cluster = lsoa_clus$cluster)\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(lsoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"cluster\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(\n      values = c(\"#feebe2\", \"#fbb4b9\", \"#f768a1\", \"#c51b8a\", \"#7a0177\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Cluster number\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.90, 0.4),\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Classification of London LSOAs based on several demographic variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason we can use cbind() to join the cluster outputs to the lsoa21 spatial file is that the LSOAs in both files are recorded in the same order. It is essential to verify that the LSOAs are indeed in the same order in both datasets, as any discrepancy will result in clusters being assigned to the wrong polygons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a geodemographic classification is an iterative process. This typically includes adding or removing variables, adjusting the number of clusters, and grouping data in different ways to achieve the most meaningful segmentation. Try to do the following:\n\nDownload the two datasets provided below and save them to your data folder. The datasets include:\n\nA csv file containing the number of people aged 16 years and older by occupational category, as defined by the Standard Occupational Classification 2020, aggregated by 2021 LSOAs.\nA csv file containing the number of people aged 16 years and older by their highest level of qualification, also aggregated to the 2021 LSOA level.\n\nPrepare these two datasets and retain only those variables that are potentially meaningful. Filter out any variables with a high proportion of zero values.\nMerge the education and occupation dataset with the dataset used to generate the initial geodemographic classification. Check for multicollinearity and consider removing any variables that are highly correlated.\nPerform \\(k\\)-means clustering on your extended dataset. Make sure to select an appropriate number of clusters for your analysis.\nInterpret the individual clusters in terms of the variables that are under- and overrepresented.\n\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Occupation\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Education\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving finished this tutorial, you should now understand the basics of a geodemographic classification.

To do this we first need to prepare the individual datasets, as well as transform and standardise the input variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(k\\)-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data into a predefined number of clusters, based on similarities between data points. It works by initially assigning \\(k\\) random centroids, then iteratively updating them by assigning each data point to the nearest centroid and recalculating the centroid’s position based on the mean of the points in each cluster. The process continues until the centroids stabilise, meaning they no longer change significantly. \\(k\\)-means is often used for tasks such as data segmentation, image compression, or anomaly detection. It is simple but may not work well with non-spherical or overlapping clusters.\n\n\n\nBecause all the data are stored in long format, with each London LSOA appearing on multiple rows for each category — such as separate rows for different age groups, ethnicities, countries of birth, and first or preferred languages - we need to transform it into a wide format. For example, instead of having multiple rows for an LSOA showing counts for different age groups all the information for each LSOA will be consolidated into a single row. Additionally, we will clean up the column names to follow standard R naming conventions and make the data easier to work with. Like we have done previously, we can automate this process using the janitor package.\nWe will begin with the age dataframe:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# clean names\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# pivot\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"age_5_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\")\n\n# clean names\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your clean_names() function returns an error, it is likely due to a conflict with another library that also includes a clean_names() function. In such cases, R cannot determine which one to use. To resolve this, you can specify the library explicitly by using janitor::clean_names().\n\n\n\nTo account for the non-uniformity of the areal units, we further need to convert the observations to proportions and only retain those columns that are likely to be meaningful in the context of the classification:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# total observations\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(age_pop = sum(across(2:6)))\n\n# total proportions, select columns\nlsoa_age &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:6, ~./age_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(1:6)\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa_age)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n# Rowwise: \n  lower_layer_super_output_areas_code aged_15_years_and_un…¹ aged_16_to_24_years\n  &lt;chr&gt;                                                &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E01000001                                           0.0846              0.0744\n2 E01000002                                           0.0621              0.0889\n3 E01000003                                           0.0682              0.0706\n4 E01000005                                           0.127               0.178 \n5 E01000006                                           0.224               0.120 \n6 E01000007                                           0.257               0.103 \n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​aged_15_years_and_under\n# ℹ 3 more variables: aged_25_to_34_years &lt;dbl&gt;, aged_35_to_49_years &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   aged_50_years_and_over &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThis looks much better. We can do the same for the country of birth data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# prepare country of birth data\nlsoa_cob &lt;- lsoa_cob |&gt;\n    clean_names() |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"country_of_birth_8_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\") |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# proportions, select columns\nlsoa_cob &lt;- lsoa_cob |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(cob_pop = sum(across(2:9))) |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:9, ~./cob_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(-2, -10)\n\n\nAnd we can do the same for the ethnicity and language datasets:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# prepare ethnicity data\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    clean_names() |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"ethnic_group_20_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\") |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# proportions, select columns\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(eth_pop = sum(across(2:21))) |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:21, ~./eth_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(-2, -22)\n\n# prepare language data\nlsoa_lan &lt;- lsoa_lan |&gt;\n    clean_names() |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\", names_from = \"main_language_11_categories\",\n        values_from = \"observation\") |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# proportions, select columns\nlsoa_lan &lt;- lsoa_lan |&gt;\n    rowwise() |&gt;\n    mutate(lan_pop = sum(across(2:12))) |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:12, ~./lan_pop)) |&gt;\n    select(-2, -11, -13)\n\n\nWe now have four separate datasets, each containing the proportions of usual residents classified into different groups based on age, country of birth, ethnicity, and language.\n\n\n\nWhere we initially selected variables from different demographic domains, not all variables may be suitable for inclusion. Firstly, the variables need to exhibit sufficient heterogeneity to ensure they capture meaningful differences between observations. Secondly, variables should not be highly correlated with one another, as this redundancy can skew the clustering results. Ensuring acceptable correlation between variables helps maintain the diversity of information and improves the robustness of the clustering outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable selection is often a time-consuming process that requires a combination of domain knowledge and more extensive exploratory analysis than is covered in this practical.\n\n\n\nA straightforward yet effective method to examine the distribution of our variables is to create boxplots for each variable. This can be efficiently achieved by using facet_wrap() from the ggplot2 library to generate a matrix of panels, allowing us to visualise all variables in a single view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a popular data visualisation package in R, designed for creating complex plots. It uses the Grammar of Graphics to build layered, customisable graphics by mapping data to visual elements like colour, size, and shape. We will explore the ggplot2 library further in Weeks 9 and 10. In the meantime, you can refer to the ggplot2 documentation for more details on facet_wrap().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# wide to long\nlsoa_age_wd &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(cols = c(2:5), names_to = \"agegroup\", values_to = \"count\")\n\n# facet age\nggplot(lsoa_age_wd, aes(y = count)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~agegroup, ncol = 2) +\n    theme_minimal() + ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Boxplots of the distribution of the age dataset.\n\n\n\n\nWhen repeating this process for the birth, ethnicity, and language variables, you will notice that some variables have a very limited distribution. Specifically, some variables may have a value of 0 for the majority of London LSOAs. As a rule of thumb, we will retain only those variables where at least 75% of the LSOAs have values different from 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis threshold of 75% is arbitrary, and in practice, more thorough consideration should be given when deciding whether to include or exclude a variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join\nlsoa_df &lt;- lsoa_age |&gt;\n    left_join(lsoa_cob, by = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\") |&gt;\n    left_join(lsoa_eth, by = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\") |&gt;\n    left_join(lsoa_lan, by = \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\")\n\n# calculate proportion of zeroes\nzero_prop &lt;- sapply(lsoa_df[2:41], function(x) {\n    mean(x == 0)\n})\n\n# extract variables with high proportion zeroes\nidx &lt;- which(zero_prop &gt; 0.25)\n\n# inspect\nidx\n\n\n   white_gypsy_or_irish_traveller            any_other_uk_languages \n                               27                                33 \n  oceanic_or_australian_languages north_or_south_american_languages \n                               37                                38 \n\n# remove variables with high proportion zeroes\nlsoa_df &lt;- lsoa_df |&gt;\n    select(-white_gypsy_or_irish_traveller, -any_other_uk_languages, -oceanic_or_australian_languages,\n        -north_or_south_american_languages)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code above makes use of Boolean logic to calculate the proportion of zeroes within each variable. The x == 0 part checks each value in column x to see if it is equal to 0, returning TRUE or FALSE for each element. The mean() function is then used to calculate the average of the TRUE values in the column. Since TRUE is treated as 1 and FALSE as 0, this gives the proportion of values in the column that are equal to zero.\n\n\n\nWe can subsequently check for multicollinearity of the remaining variables. The easiest way to check the correlations between all variables is probably by visualising a correlation matrix:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect variable names\nnames(lsoa_df)\n\n\n [1] \"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\"                                  \n [2] \"aged_15_years_and_under\"                                              \n [3] \"aged_16_to_24_years\"                                                  \n [4] \"aged_25_to_34_years\"                                                  \n [5] \"aged_35_to_49_years\"                                                  \n [6] \"aged_50_years_and_over\"                                               \n [7] \"europe_united_kingdom\"                                                \n [8] \"europe_ireland\"                                                       \n [9] \"europe_other_europe\"                                                  \n[10] \"africa\"                                                               \n[11] \"middle_east_and_asia\"                                                 \n[12] \"the_americas_and_the_caribbean\"                                       \n[13] \"antarctica_and_oceania_including_australasia_and_other\"               \n[14] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_bangladeshi\"                       \n[15] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_chinese\"                           \n[16] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_indian\"                            \n[17] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_pakistani\"                         \n[18] \"asian_asian_british_or_asian_welsh_other_asian\"                       \n[19] \"black_black_british_black_welsh_caribbean_or_african_african\"         \n[20] \"black_black_british_black_welsh_caribbean_or_african_caribbean\"       \n[21] \"black_black_british_black_welsh_caribbean_or_african_other_black\"     \n[22] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_white_and_asian\"                      \n[23] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_white_and_black_african\"              \n[24] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_white_and_black_caribbean\"            \n[25] \"mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups_other_mixed_or_multiple_ethnic_groups\"\n[26] \"white_english_welsh_scottish_northern_irish_or_british\"               \n[27] \"white_irish\"                                                          \n[28] \"white_roma\"                                                           \n[29] \"white_other_white\"                                                    \n[30] \"other_ethnic_group_arab\"                                              \n[31] \"other_ethnic_group_any_other_ethnic_group\"                            \n[32] \"english_or_welsh\"                                                     \n[33] \"european_languages_eu\"                                                \n[34] \"other_european_languages_non_eu\"                                      \n[35] \"asian_languages\"                                                      \n[36] \"african_languages\"                                                    \n[37] \"any_other_languages\"                                                  \n\n# change variable names to index to improve visualisation\nlsoa_df_vis &lt;- lsoa_df\nnames(lsoa_df_vis)[2:37] &lt;- paste0(\"v\", sprintf(\"%02d\", 1:36))\n\n# correlation matrix\ncor_mat &lt;- cor(lsoa_df_vis[, -1])\n\n# correlation plot\nggcorrplot(cor_mat, outline.col = \"#ffffff\", tl.cex = 8, legend.title = \"Correlation\")\n\nWarning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.\nℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.\nℹ See also `vignette(\"ggplot2-in-packages\")` for more information.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggcorrplot package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/kassambara/ggcorrplot/issues&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Correlation plot of classification variables.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the approach from Wyszomierski et al. (2024), we can define a weak correlation as lying between 0 and 0.40, moderate as between 0.41 and 0.65, strong as between 0.66 and 0.80, and very strong as between 0.81 and 1.\nA few strong and very strong correlations can be observed that potentially could be removed; however, to maintain representation, here we decide to retain all variables.\n\n\n\nIf the input data are heavily skewed or contain outliers, \\(k\\)-means may produce less meaningful clusters. While normality is not required per se, it has been common to do this nonetheless. More important is to standardise the input variables, especially when they are measured on different scales. This ensures that each variable contributes equally to the clustering process.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inverse hyperbolic sine\nlsoa_df_vis[, -1] &lt;- sapply(lsoa_df_vis[-1], asinh)\n\n# range standardise\nlsoa_df_vis[, -1] &lt;- sapply(lsoa_df_vis[-1], function(x) {\n    (x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))\n})\n\n\n\n\n\nNow our data are prepared we will start by creating an elbow plot. The elbow method is a visual tool that helps determine the optimal number of clusters in a dataset. This is important because with \\(k\\)-means clustering you need to specify the numbers of clusters a priori. The elbow method involves running the clustering algorithm with varying numbers of clusters (\\(k\\)) and plotting the total explained variation (known as the Within Sum of Squares) against the number of clusters. The goal is to identify the elbow point on the curve, where the rate of decrease in explained variation starts to slow. This point suggests that adding more clusters yields diminishing returns in terms of explained variation.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# elbow plot\nfviz_nbclust(lsoa_df_vis[, -1], kmeans, nstart = 100, iter.max = 100, method = \"wss\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Elbow plot with Within Sum of Squares against number of clusters.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the elbow plot, we can now choose the number of clusters and it looks like 6 clusters would be a reasonable choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interpretation of an elbow plot can be quite subjective, and multiple options for the optimal number of clusters might be justified; for instance, 4, 5, or even 7 clusters could be reasonable choices. In addition to the elbow method, other techniques can aid in determining the optimal number of clusters, such as silhouette scores and the gap statistic. An alternative and helful approach is to use a clustergram, which is a two-dimensional plot that visualises the flows of observations between clusters as more clusters are added. This method illustrates how your data reshuffles with each additional cluster and provides insights into the quality of the splits. This method can be done in R, but currently easier to implement in Python.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have decided on the number of clusters, we can run our \\(k\\)-means analysis.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(999)\n\n# k-means\nlsoa_clus &lt;- kmeans(lsoa_df_vis[, -1], centers = 6, nstart = 100, iter.max = 100)\n\n\nWe can inspect the object to get some information about our clusters:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\nlsoa_clus\n\n\nK-means clustering with 6 clusters of sizes 796, 1097, 771, 1011, 851, 468\n\nCluster means:\n        v01       v02       v03       v04       v05       v06       v07\n1 0.4816225 0.1632210 0.2425566 0.4838983 0.4169123 0.5410477 0.1337158\n        v08       v09       v10        v11        v12        v13        v14\n1 0.3007540 0.2480613 0.2859754 0.08913663 0.05177222 0.14603013 0.06993627\n         v15        v16        v17        v18        v19        v20        v21\n1 0.12176548 0.10935022 0.20109979 0.18150482 0.11605092 0.12757934 0.09288236\n         v22        v23       v24       v25       v26        v27       v28\n1 0.07473711 0.14662903 0.1842217 0.3522638 0.1490577 0.02997040 0.2423784\n         v29       v30       v31       v32        v33        v34        v35\n1 0.07148504 0.2193009 0.5870244 0.2411272 0.07541661 0.23467242 0.10174187\n         v36\n1 0.10216507\n [ reached 'max' / getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 5 rows ]\n\nClustering vector:\n [1] 4 4 4 1 1 5 5 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1\n[39] 1 1 1 1 5 1 5 1 1 1 1 1\n [ reached 'max' / getOption(\"max.print\") -- omitted 4944 entries ]\n\nWithin cluster sum of squares by cluster:\n[1] 259.0272 177.7951 288.8625 232.7770 298.9145 160.1702\n (between_SS / total_SS =  48.5 %)\n\nAvailable components:\n\n[1] \"cluster\"      \"centers\"      \"totss\"        \"withinss\"     \"tot.withinss\"\n[6] \"betweenss\"    \"size\"         \"iter\"         \"ifault\"      \n\n\n\n\n\nWe now need to perform some post-processing to extract useful summary data for each cluster. To characterise the clusters, we can compare the global mean values of each variable with the mean values specific to each cluster.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# global means\nglob_means &lt;- colMeans(lsoa_df_vis[, -1])\n\n# add clusters to input data\nlsoa_df_vis &lt;- cbind(lsoa_df_vis, cluster = lsoa_clus$cluster)\n\n# cluster means\ncluster_means &lt;- lsoa_df_vis |&gt;\n    group_by(cluster) |&gt;\n    summarise(across(2:37, mean))\n\n# difference\ncluster_diffs &lt;- cluster_means |&gt;\n    mutate(across(2:37, ~. - glob_means[cur_column()]))\n\n\nThese comparisons can then be visualised using, for instance, a radial bar plot:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to long format\ncluster_diffs_long &lt;- cluster_diffs |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(!cluster, names_to = \"vars\", values_to = \"score\")\n\n# facet clusters\nggplot(cluster_diffs_long, aes(x = factor(vars), y = score)) + geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    coord_radial(rotate.angle = TRUE, expand = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~cluster, ncol = 3) +\n    theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7)) + xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Radial barplots of cluster means for each input variable.\n\n\n\n\nThese plots can serve as a foundation for creating pen portraits by closely examining which variables drive each cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor easier interpretation, these values can be transformed into index scores, allowing us to assess which variables are under- or overrepresented within each cluster group.\n\n\n\nOf course, we can also map the results:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read spatial dataset\nlsoa21 &lt;- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n\n\nReading layer `London-LSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 4994 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n# join\nlsoa21 &lt;- cbind(lsoa21, cluster = lsoa_clus$cluster)\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(lsoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"cluster\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_categorical(\n      values = c(\"#feebe2\", \"#fbb4b9\", \"#f768a1\", \"#c51b8a\", \"#7a0177\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Cluster number\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.90, 0.4),\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Classification of London LSOAs based on several demographic variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason we can use cbind() to join the cluster outputs to the lsoa21 spatial file is that the LSOAs in both files are recorded in the same order. It is essential to verify that the LSOAs are indeed in the same order in both datasets, as any discrepancy will result in clusters being assigned to the wrong polygons."

This week, we will expand on this by exploring bivariate maps, which illustrate the relationship between two variables within a single visualisation. We will also introduce you to the ggplot2 library and pay some attention to creating functions to automate and repeat analyses for different spatial units, allowing for more efficient and consistent workflows\n\n\nYou can download the slides of this week’s lecture here: [Link].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLongley, P. et al. 2015.

Specifically, we will try to reconcile 2011 Census data with 2021 Census data and present the results on a bivariate map. The data cover all usual residents, as recorded in the 2011 and 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative geographies, such as LSOAs, are periodically updated to reflect changes in population and other factors, resulting in occasional boundary adjustments. Consequently, it is essential to use the 2011 LSOA boundaries when mapping 2011 Census data and the 2021 LSOA boundaries for 2021 Census data. To facilitate mapping changes over time, we have access to a csv file containing a best-fit lookup table. This table provides a correspondence between 2011 LSOAs and their equivalent 2021 LSOAs, enabling consistent comparison across census periods.\n\n\n\nYou can download three files below and save them in your project folder under data/attributes. Along with these dataset, we also have access to a GeoPackage that contains the 2021 LSOA boundaries.\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2011 Unemployment\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Unemployment\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nEngland and Wales LSOA 2011-2021 Lookup\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\nOpen a new script within your GEOG0030 project and save this as w09-unemployment-change.r.\nBegin by loading the necessary libraries:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(biscale)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have to install some of these libraries if you have not used these before.\n\n\n\nOnce downloaded, we can load all three files into memory:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read 2011 data\nlsoa11 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/London-LSOA-Unemployment-2011.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 4835 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): lsoa11cd, lsoa11nm\ndbl (2): eco_active_unemployed11, pop11\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# read 2021 data\nlsoa21 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/London-LSOA-Unemployment-2021.csv\")\n\nRows: 4994 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): lsoa21cd, lsoa21nm\ndbl (2): eco_active_unemployed21, pop21\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# read lookup data\nlookup &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/England-Wales-LSOA-2011-2021.csv\")\n\nRows: 35796 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): lsoa11cd, lsoa11nm, lsoa21cd, lsoa21nm, chgind\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa11)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  lsoa11cd  lsoa11nm                  eco_active_unemployed11 pop11\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E01000001 City of London 001A                            34  1221\n2 E01000002 City of London 001B                            16  1196\n3 E01000003 City of London 001C                            39  1102\n4 E01000005 City of London 001E                            46   773\n5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A                      83  1251\n6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A                      87  1034\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa21)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  lsoa21cd  lsoa21nm                  eco_active_unemployed21 pop21\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E01000001 City of London 001A                            32  1478\n2 E01000002 City of London 001B                            30  1383\n3 E01000003 City of London 001C                            68  1614\n4 E01000005 City of London 001E                            60  1099\n5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A                      57  1844\n6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A                     154  2908\n\n# inspect\nhead(lookup)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  lsoa11cd  lsoa11nm                  lsoa21cd  lsoa21nm                  chgind\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt; \n1 E01000001 City of London 001A       E01000001 City of London 001A       U     \n2 E01000002 City of London 001B       E01000002 City of London 001B       U     \n3 E01000003 City of London 001C       E01000003 City of London 001C       U     \n4 E01000005 City of London 001E       E01000005 City of London 001E       U     \n5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A U     \n6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A U     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect both objects using the View() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo analyse changes in unemployment over time, we need to combine the 2011 and 2021 unemployment data. Previously, we have joined datasets using a unique identifier found in both, assuming the identifiers match exactly and represent the same geographies. However, when comparing the unique identifiers from (lsoa11cd and lsoa21cd) these datasets, we can see some clear differences:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\nlength(unique(lsoa11$lsoa11cd))\n\n\n[1] 4835\n\n# inspect\nlength(unique(lsoa21$lsoa21cd))\n\n[1] 4994\n\n\nThe number of LSOAs increased between the 2011 and 2021 Census due to boundary changes. Specifically, some 2011 LSOAs have been split into multiple 2021 LSOAs, while others have been merged into a single 2021 LSOA polygon. The relationship between 2011 and 2021 LSOAs is captured in the chgind column of the lookup table, which flags the type of change for each case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nU\nUnchanged: The LSOA boundaries remain the same from 2011 to 2021, allowing direct comparisons between data for these years.\n\n\nS\nSplit: A 2011 LSOA has been divided into two or more 2021 LSOAs. Each split 2021 LSOA will have a corresponding record in the table, enabling comparisons by aggregating the 2021 LSOA data back to the 2011 boundary.\n\n\nM\nMerged: Two or more 2011 LSOAs have been combined into a single 2021 LSOA. Comparisons can be made by aggregating the 2011 LSOA data to match the new 2021 boundary.\n\n\nX\nIrregular/Fragmented: The relationship between 2011 and 2021 LSOAs is complex due to redesigns from local authority boundary changes or efforts to improve social homogeneity. These cases do not allow straightforward comparisons between 2011 and 2021 data.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are different approaches to handling this, today we will:\n\nDivide the total crimes for 2011 LSOAs that have been split equally across the corresponding 2021 LSOAs.\nCombine the total crimes for 2011 LSOAs that have been merged into a single 2021 LSOA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LSOA boundary changes in London between 2011 and 2021 did not result in any irregular or fragmented boundaries. Therefore, we only need to address the merged and split LSOAs.\n\n\n\nThis means we will apply weightings to the values based on their relationships. We can prepare these weightings as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# for unchanged LSOAs keep weighting the same\nlsoa_lookup_same &lt;- lookup |&gt;\n    filter(chgind == \"U\") |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa11cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(n = n())\n\n# for merged LSOAs: keep weighting the same\nlsoa_lookup_merge &lt;- lookup |&gt;\n    filter(chgind == \"M\") |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa11cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(n = n())\n\n# for split LSOAs: weigh proportionally to the number of 2021 LSOAs\nlsoa_lookup_split &lt;- lookup |&gt;\n    filter(chgind == \"S\") |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa11cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(n = 1/n())\n\n# re-combine the lookup with updated weightings\nlsoa_lookup &lt;- rbind(lsoa_lookup_same, lsoa_lookup_merge, lsoa_lookup_split)\n\n# inspect\nlsoa_lookup\n\n\n# A tibble: 35,786 × 6\n# Groups:   lsoa11cd [34,747]\n   lsoa11cd  lsoa11nm                  lsoa21cd  lsoa21nm           chgind     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 E01000001 City of London 001A       E01000001 City of London 00… U          1\n 2 E01000002 City of London 001B       E01000002 City of London 00… U          1\n 3 E01000003 City of London 001C       E01000003 City of London 00… U          1\n 4 E01000005 City of London 001E       E01000005 City of London 00… U          1\n 5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A E01000006 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A E01000007 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 7 E01000008 Barking and Dagenham 015B E01000008 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 8 E01000009 Barking and Dagenham 016B E01000009 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 9 E01000011 Barking and Dagenham 016C E01000011 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n10 E01000012 Barking and Dagenham 015D E01000012 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n# ℹ 35,776 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect both objects using the View() function.\n\n\n\nWe can now join the lookup table on the 2011 LSOA data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join to lsoa data\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11 |&gt;\n  select(-lsoa11nm) |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa_lookup, by = c(\"lsoa11cd\" = \"lsoa11cd\"))\n\n\nIf we now compare the number of records in our lsoa11_21 dataset with the original 2011 and 2021 LSOA datasets, we notice some differences:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# lsoa 2011\nnrow(lsoa11)\n\n\n[1] 4835\n\n# lsoa 2021\nnrow(lsoa21)\n\n[1] 4994\n\n# lookup\nnrow(lsoa11_21)\n\n[1] 5016\n\n\nSomehow, the number of our LSOAs seem to have increased. However, this is not an actual increase in LSOAs; rather, the change in the number of LSOAs is due to our one-to-many relationships. A single 2011 LSOA can correspond to multiple 2021 LSOAs, which causes the data for that 2011 LSOA to be duplicated in the join operation. Fortunately, we anticipated this and have already created the necessary weightings. We can now apply these weightings to assign our 2011 population estimates to the 2021 LSOA boundaries as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# weigh data\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    mutate(eco_active_unemployed11 = eco_active_unemployed11 * n) |&gt;\n    mutate(pop11 = pop11 * n)\n\n# assign 2011 to 2021\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa21cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(eco_active_unemployed11_lsoa21 = sum(eco_active_unemployed11)) |&gt;\n    mutate(pop11_lsoa21 = sum(pop11)) |&gt;\n    distinct(lsoa21cd, eco_active_unemployed11_lsoa21, pop11_lsoa21)\n\n\nWe should now be left with all 2021 LSOAs, each containing the corresponding 2011 values, adjusted according to the merged and split LSOA relationships. We can quickly check this by comparing the original values with the re-assigned values:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect number\nnrow(lsoa21)\n\n\n[1] 4994\n\n# inspect number\nnrow(lsoa11_21)\n\n[1] 4994\n\n# inspect count original data\nsum(lsoa11$pop11)\n\n[1] 6117482\n\n# inspect count re-assigned data\nsum(lsoa11_21$pop11_lsoa21)\n\n[1] 6117482\n\n\nWe can now join the 2011 and 2021 population data together:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join 2011 data with 2021 data\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa21, by = c(\"lsoa21cd\" = \"lsoa21cd\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nBivariate maps are visualisations that represent two different variables simultaneously on a single map, using combinations of colours, patterns, or symbols to convey relationships between them. They are commonly used to explore spatial correlations or patterns, such as comparing population density with income levels across a region. We will use a bivariate map to illustrate changes in unemployment between 2011 and 2021 in London.\nWe will start by calculating unemployment rates for both years and classifing them into categories using the biscale library:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# unemployment rates\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    mutate(unemp11 = eco_active_unemployed11_lsoa21/pop11_lsoa21) |&gt;\n    mutate(unemp21 = eco_active_unemployed21/pop21) |&gt;\n    select(-lsoa21nm)\n\n# add classes\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    bi_class(x = unemp21, y = unemp11, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa11_21$bi_class)\n\n\n[1] \"1-1\" \"1-1\" \"3-1\" \"3-2\" \"2-3\" \"3-3\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dim argument is used to control the extent of the legend. For instance, dim = 2 will produce a two-by-two map where dim = 3 will produce a three-by-three map.\n\n\n\nInstead of using tmap to create our map, we will need to use the ggplot2 library. Like tmap, ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, allowing you to build a graphic step by step by layering components such as data, aesthetics, and geometries. While we will explore ggplot2 in more detail next week, for now, we will use it to create a bivariate map by adding the necessary layers one at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBivariate maps are not supported in Version 3 of tmap. However, Version 4, which is currently under development, will include functionality for creating bivariate maps. This new version is expected to be released on CRAN soon\n\n\n\nOnce breaks are created, we can use bi_scale_fill() as part of our ggplot() call:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# load spatial data\nlsoa21_sf &lt;- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n\n\nReading layer `London-LSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 4994 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n# join unemployment data\nlsoa21_sf &lt;- lsoa21_sf |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa11_21, by = c(\"lsoa21cd\" = \"lsoa21cd\"))\n\n# bivariate map using ggplot\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = lsoa21_sf,\n    mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n    color = NA,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  bi_scale_fill(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3\n  ) +\n  bi_theme()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bivariate map change of unemployment rates in London 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\nShades closer to grey indicate areas with relative low unemployment rates in both years, while shades closer to blue represent areas with high unemployment rates in both years. Mixed tones suggest areas where unemployment rates have changed between 2011 and 2021, with the specific colour intensity reflecting the degree and direction of this change.\nWe have set show.legend = FALSE to allow us to manually add our own bivariate legend. The palette and dimensions should align with those used in bi_class() for dimensions and bi_scale_fill() for both dimensions and palette to ensure consistency. We can create a legend and combine it with a map object as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# bivariate map object\nmap &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = lsoa21_sf,\n    mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n    color = NA,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  bi_scale_fill(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3\n  ) +\n  bi_theme()\n\n# legend object\nlegend &lt;- bi_legend(\n  pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n  dim = 3,\n  xlab = \"Higher Unemployment 2021\",\n  ylab = \"Higher Unemployment 2011\",\n  size = 6\n)\n\n# combine, draw\nggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(legend, 0, 0, .3, 0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in London 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values in the draw_plot() function specify the relative location and size of each map object on the canvas. Adjusting these values often requires some trial and error to achieve the desired positioning, as they control the x and y coordinates for placement and the width and height proportions of each object.\n\n\n\nWe have used LSOA data to create a bivariate map illustrating changes in unemployment rates. However, with nearly 5,000 LSOAs in London, this map can be challenging to interpret due to the high level of detail. Let’s zoom in to Lambeth:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# select lambeth\nlsoa21_lambeth &lt;- lsoa21_sf |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(lsoa21nm, \"Lambeth\"))\n\n# add classes\nlsoa21_lambeth &lt;- lsoa21_lambeth |&gt;\n  bi_class(x = unemp21, y = unemp11, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n# bivariate map object\nmap &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = lsoa21_lambeth,\n    mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n    color = NA,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  bi_scale_fill(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3\n  ) +\n  bi_theme()\n\n# legend object\nlegend &lt;- bi_legend(\n  pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n  dim = 3,\n  xlab = \"Higher Unemployment 2021\",\n  ylab = \"Higher Unemployment 2011\",\n  size = 6\n)\n\n# combine, draw\nbivmap &lt;- ggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(legend, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3)\n\n# plot\nbivmap\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Lambeth 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we have now created a map of Lambeth. But what if we need to create a map for every borough in London? In R, you can create a basic function using the function() keyword, which allows you to encapsulate reusable code. A function can take arguments (inputs), perform operations, and return a result. A simple example of a function that adds two values together:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define function to add two numbers\nadd_numbers &lt;- function(a, b) {\n    result &lt;- a + b\n    return(result)\n}\n\n# use function\nadd_numbers(5, 3)\n\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nWe can use the same logic to construct a basic function that takes a spatial dataframe and the name of a borough as input and subsequently creates a bivarate map as output:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define function to create bivariate unemployment maps\ncreate_bivariate_map &lt;- function(spatial_df, borough_name) {\n  # select borough\n  spatial_df_filter &lt;- spatial_df |&gt;\n    filter(str_detect(lsoa21nm, borough_name))\n\n  # add classes\n  spatial_df_filter &lt;- spatial_df_filter |&gt;\n    bi_class(x = unemp21, y = unemp11, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n  # bivariate map object\n  map &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(\n      data = spatial_df_filter,\n      mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n      color = NA,\n      show.legend = FALSE\n    ) +\n    bi_scale_fill(\n      pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n      dim = 3\n    ) +\n    bi_theme()\n\n  # legend object\n  legend &lt;- bi_legend(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3,\n    xlab = \"Higher Unemployment 2021\",\n    ylab = \"Higher Unemployment 2011\",\n    size = 6\n  )\n\n  # combine\n  bivariate_map &lt;- ggdraw() +\n    draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n    draw_plot(legend, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3)\n\n  # return value\n  return(bivariate_map)\n}\n\n\nWe can now use this function to quickly recreate maps for individual boroughs. Let’s try it for the London Borough of Hammersmith:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run function\ncreate_bivariate_map(lsoa21_sf, \"Hammersmith\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Hammersmith 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about Kensington and Chelsea? Or Wandsworth?\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run function\ncreate_bivariate_map(lsoa21_sf, \"Kensington and Chelsea\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Kensington and Chelsea 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run function\ncreate_bivariate_map(lsoa21_sf, \"Wandsworth\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Wandsworth 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the same action, such as mapping a particular variable, needs to be repeated across different datasets or regions, a function ensures that the process is consistent and can be applied easily without rewriting code. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors, as you can simply call the function with different inputs, ensuring the same analysis steps are followed each time.\nHaving created a function to generate bivariate maps, we can now create a function for univariate maps. Using the dataset from the tutorial, try to:\n\nWrite a function with two parameters that uses the standard tmap library to map unemployment rates at the LSOA-level for a specified borough.\nAdd a third parameter that specifies which variable should be mapped (e.g., unemployment rates in 2011 or 2021).\nAdd a fourth parameter to define the colour palette to be used for the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like a more comprehensive introduction to writing your own functions in R, refer to Chapter 19: Functions in R for Data Science. This chapter provides a detailed explanation of how to create and use functions, along with best practices for making your code more efficient and reusable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is it for today. You should now be able to use lookup tables, create bivariate maps with the ggplot2 library, and build basic reproducible functions. Next week, we will dive deeper into the ggplot2 library, but for now that is this week’s Geocompuation done!"

    "text": "This week, we will look at the change in unemployment across London between 2011 and 2021. Specifically, we will try to reconcile 2011 Census data with 2021 Census data and present the results on a bivariate map. The data cover all usual residents, as recorded in the 2011 and 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative geographies, such as LSOAs, are periodically updated to reflect changes in population and other factors, resulting in occasional boundary adjustments. Consequently, it is essential to use the 2011 LSOA boundaries when mapping 2011 Census data and the 2021 LSOA boundaries for 2021 Census data. To facilitate mapping changes over time, we have access to a csv file containing a best-fit lookup table. This table provides a correspondence between 2011 LSOAs and their equivalent 2021 LSOAs, enabling consistent comparison across census periods.\n\n\n\nYou can download three files below and save them in your project folder under data/attributes. Along with these dataset, we also have access to a GeoPackage that contains the 2021 LSOA boundaries.\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2011 Unemployment\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA Census 2021 Unemployment\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nEngland and Wales LSOA 2011-2021 Lookup\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon LSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\nOpen a new script within your GEOG0030 project and save this as w09-unemployment-change.r.\nBegin by loading the necessary libraries:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(biscale)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have to install some of these libraries if you have not used these before.\n\n\n\nOnce downloaded, we can load all three files into memory:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read 2011 data\nlsoa11 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/London-LSOA-Unemployment-2011.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 4835 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): lsoa11cd, lsoa11nm\ndbl (2): eco_active_unemployed11, pop11\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# read 2021 data\nlsoa21 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/London-LSOA-Unemployment-2021.csv\")\n\nRows: 4994 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (2): lsoa21cd, lsoa21nm\ndbl (2): eco_active_unemployed21, pop21\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# read lookup data\nlookup &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/England-Wales-LSOA-2011-2021.csv\")\n\nRows: 35796 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): lsoa11cd, lsoa11nm, lsoa21cd, lsoa21nm, chgind\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa11)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  lsoa11cd  lsoa11nm                  eco_active_unemployed11 pop11\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E01000001 City of London 001A                            34  1221\n2 E01000002 City of London 001B                            16  1196\n3 E01000003 City of London 001C                            39  1102\n4 E01000005 City of London 001E                            46   773\n5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A                      83  1251\n6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A                      87  1034\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa21)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  lsoa21cd  lsoa21nm                  eco_active_unemployed21 pop21\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                                       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E01000001 City of London 001A                            32  1478\n2 E01000002 City of London 001B                            30  1383\n3 E01000003 City of London 001C                            68  1614\n4 E01000005 City of London 001E                            60  1099\n5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A                      57  1844\n6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A                     154  2908\n\n# inspect\nhead(lookup)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  lsoa11cd  lsoa11nm                  lsoa21cd  lsoa21nm                  chgind\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt; \n1 E01000001 City of London 001A       E01000001 City of London 001A       U     \n2 E01000002 City of London 001B       E01000002 City of London 001B       U     \n3 E01000003 City of London 001C       E01000003 City of London 001C       U     \n4 E01000005 City of London 001E       E01000005 City of London 001E       U     \n5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A U     \n6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A U     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect both objects using the View() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo analyse changes in unemployment over time, we need to combine the 2011 and 2021 unemployment data. Previously, we have joined datasets using a unique identifier found in both, assuming the identifiers match exactly and represent the same geographies. However, when comparing the unique identifiers from (lsoa11cd and lsoa21cd) these datasets, we can see some clear differences:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\nlength(unique(lsoa11$lsoa11cd))\n\n\n[1] 4835\n\n# inspect\nlength(unique(lsoa21$lsoa21cd))\n\n[1] 4994\n\n\nThe number of LSOAs increased between the 2011 and 2021 Census due to boundary changes. Specifically, some 2011 LSOAs have been split into multiple 2021 LSOAs, while others have been merged into a single 2021 LSOA polygon. The relationship between 2011 and 2021 LSOAs is captured in the chgind column of the lookup table, which flags the type of change for each case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nU\nUnchanged: The LSOA boundaries remain the same from 2011 to 2021, allowing direct comparisons between data for these years.\n\n\nS\nSplit: A 2011 LSOA has been divided into two or more 2021 LSOAs. Each split 2021 LSOA will have a corresponding record in the table, enabling comparisons by aggregating the 2021 LSOA data back to the 2011 boundary.\n\n\nM\nMerged: Two or more 2011 LSOAs have been combined into a single 2021 LSOA. Comparisons can be made by aggregating the 2011 LSOA data to match the new 2021 boundary.\n\n\nX\nIrregular/Fragmented: The relationship between 2011 and 2021 LSOAs is complex due to redesigns from local authority boundary changes or efforts to improve social homogeneity. These cases do not allow straightforward comparisons between 2011 and 2021 data.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are different approaches to handling this, today we will:\n\nDivide the total crimes for 2011 LSOAs that have been split equally across the corresponding 2021 LSOAs.\nCombine the total crimes for 2011 LSOAs that have been merged into a single 2021 LSOA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LSOA boundary changes in London between 2011 and 2021 did not result in any irregular or fragmented boundaries. Therefore, we only need to address the merged and split LSOAs.\n\n\n\nThis means we will apply weightings to the values based on their relationships. We can prepare these weightings as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# for unchanged LSOAs keep weighting the same\nlsoa_lookup_same &lt;- lookup |&gt;\n    filter(chgind == \"U\") |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa11cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(n = n())\n\n# for merged LSOAs: keep weighting the same\nlsoa_lookup_merge &lt;- lookup |&gt;\n    filter(chgind == \"M\") |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa11cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(n = n())\n\n# for split LSOAs: weigh proportionally to the number of 2021 LSOAs\nlsoa_lookup_split &lt;- lookup |&gt;\n    filter(chgind == \"S\") |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa11cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(n = 1/n())\n\n# re-combine the lookup with updated weightings\nlsoa_lookup &lt;- rbind(lsoa_lookup_same, lsoa_lookup_merge, lsoa_lookup_split)\n\n# inspect\nlsoa_lookup\n\n\n# A tibble: 35,786 × 6\n# Groups:   lsoa11cd [34,747]\n   lsoa11cd  lsoa11nm                  lsoa21cd  lsoa21nm           chgind     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 E01000001 City of London 001A       E01000001 City of London 00… U          1\n 2 E01000002 City of London 001B       E01000002 City of London 00… U          1\n 3 E01000003 City of London 001C       E01000003 City of London 00… U          1\n 4 E01000005 City of London 001E       E01000005 City of London 00… U          1\n 5 E01000006 Barking and Dagenham 016A E01000006 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 6 E01000007 Barking and Dagenham 015A E01000007 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 7 E01000008 Barking and Dagenham 015B E01000008 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 8 E01000009 Barking and Dagenham 016B E01000009 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n 9 E01000011 Barking and Dagenham 016C E01000011 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n10 E01000012 Barking and Dagenham 015D E01000012 Barking and Dagen… U          1\n# ℹ 35,776 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can inspect both objects using the View() function.\n\n\n\nWe can now join the lookup table on the 2011 LSOA data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join to lsoa data\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11 |&gt;\n  select(-lsoa11nm) |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa_lookup, by = c(\"lsoa11cd\" = \"lsoa11cd\"))\n\n\nIf we now compare the number of records in our lsoa11_21 dataset with the original 2011 and 2021 LSOA datasets, we notice some differences:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# lsoa 2011\nnrow(lsoa11)\n\n\n[1] 4835\n\n# lsoa 2021\nnrow(lsoa21)\n\n[1] 4994\n\n# lookup\nnrow(lsoa11_21)\n\n[1] 5016\n\n\nSomehow, the number of our LSOAs seem to have increased. However, this is not an actual increase in LSOAs; rather, the change in the number of LSOAs is due to our one-to-many relationships. A single 2011 LSOA can correspond to multiple 2021 LSOAs, which causes the data for that 2011 LSOA to be duplicated in the join operation. Fortunately, we anticipated this and have already created the necessary weightings. We can now apply these weightings to assign our 2011 population estimates to the 2021 LSOA boundaries as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# weigh data\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    mutate(eco_active_unemployed11 = eco_active_unemployed11 * n) |&gt;\n    mutate(pop11 = pop11 * n)\n\n# assign 2011 to 2021\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    group_by(lsoa21cd) |&gt;\n    mutate(eco_active_unemployed11_lsoa21 = sum(eco_active_unemployed11)) |&gt;\n    mutate(pop11_lsoa21 = sum(pop11)) |&gt;\n    distinct(lsoa21cd, eco_active_unemployed11_lsoa21, pop11_lsoa21)\n\n\nWe should now be left with all 2021 LSOAs, each containing the corresponding 2011 values, adjusted according to the merged and split LSOA relationships. We can quickly check this by comparing the original values with the re-assigned values:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect number\nnrow(lsoa21)\n\n\n[1] 4994\n\n# inspect number\nnrow(lsoa11_21)\n\n[1] 4994\n\n# inspect count original data\nsum(lsoa11$pop11)\n\n[1] 6117482\n\n# inspect count re-assigned data\nsum(lsoa11_21$pop11_lsoa21)\n\n[1] 6117482\n\n\nWe can now join the 2011 and 2021 population data together:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join 2011 data with 2021 data\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa21, by = c(\"lsoa21cd\" = \"lsoa21cd\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nBivariate maps are visualisations that represent two different variables simultaneously on a single map, using combinations of colours, patterns, or symbols to convey relationships between them. They are commonly used to explore spatial correlations or patterns, such as comparing population density with income levels across a region. We will use a bivariate map to illustrate changes in unemployment between 2011 and 2021 in London.\nWe will start by calculating unemployment rates for both years and classifing them into categories using the biscale library:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# unemployment rates\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    mutate(unemp11 = eco_active_unemployed11_lsoa21/pop11_lsoa21) |&gt;\n    mutate(unemp21 = eco_active_unemployed21/pop21) |&gt;\n    select(-lsoa21nm)\n\n# add classes\nlsoa11_21 &lt;- lsoa11_21 |&gt;\n    bi_class(x = unemp21, y = unemp11, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n# inspect\nhead(lsoa11_21$bi_class)\n\n\n[1] \"1-1\" \"1-1\" \"3-1\" \"3-2\" \"2-3\" \"3-3\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dim argument is used to control the extent of the legend. For instance, dim = 2 will produce a two-by-two map where dim = 3 will produce a three-by-three map.\n\n\n\nInstead of using tmap to create our map, we will need to use the ggplot2 library. Like tmap, ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, allowing you to build a graphic step by step by layering components such as data, aesthetics, and geometries. While we will explore ggplot2 in more detail next week, for now, we will use it to create a bivariate map by adding the necessary layers one at a time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBivariate maps are not supported in Version 3 of tmap. However, Version 4, which is currently under development, will include functionality for creating bivariate maps. This new version is expected to be released on CRAN soon\n\n\n\nOnce breaks are created, we can use bi_scale_fill() as part of our ggplot() call:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# load spatial data\nlsoa21_sf &lt;- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n\n\nReading layer `London-LSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 4994 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n# join unemployment data\nlsoa21_sf &lt;- lsoa21_sf |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa11_21, by = c(\"lsoa21cd\" = \"lsoa21cd\"))\n\n# bivariate map using ggplot\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = lsoa21_sf,\n    mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n    color = NA,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  bi_scale_fill(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3\n  ) +\n  bi_theme()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bivariate map change of unemployment rates in London 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\nShades closer to grey indicate areas with relative low unemployment rates in both years, while shades closer to blue represent areas with high unemployment rates in both years. Mixed tones suggest areas where unemployment rates have changed between 2011 and 2021, with the specific colour intensity reflecting the degree and direction of this change.\nWe have set show.legend = FALSE to allow us to manually add our own bivariate legend. The palette and dimensions should align with those used in bi_class() for dimensions and bi_scale_fill() for both dimensions and palette to ensure consistency. We can create a legend and combine it with a map object as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# bivariate map object\nmap &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = lsoa21_sf,\n    mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n    color = NA,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  bi_scale_fill(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3\n  ) +\n  bi_theme()\n\n# legend object\nlegend &lt;- bi_legend(\n  pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n  dim = 3,\n  xlab = \"Higher Unemployment 2021\",\n  ylab = \"Higher Unemployment 2011\",\n  size = 6\n)\n\n# combine, draw\nggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(legend, 0, 0, .3, 0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in London 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values in the draw_plot() function specify the relative location and size of each map object on the canvas. Adjusting these values often requires some trial and error to achieve the desired positioning, as they control the x and y coordinates for placement and the width and height proportions of each object.\n\n\n\nWe have used LSOA data to create a bivariate map illustrating changes in unemployment rates. However, with nearly 5,000 LSOAs in London, this map can be challenging to interpret due to the high level of detail. Let’s zoom in to Lambeth:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# select lambeth\nlsoa21_lambeth &lt;- lsoa21_sf |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(lsoa21nm, \"Lambeth\"))\n\n# add classes\nlsoa21_lambeth &lt;- lsoa21_lambeth |&gt;\n  bi_class(x = unemp21, y = unemp11, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n# bivariate map object\nmap &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = lsoa21_lambeth,\n    mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n    color = NA,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  bi_scale_fill(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3\n  ) +\n  bi_theme()\n\n# legend object\nlegend &lt;- bi_legend(\n  pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n  dim = 3,\n  xlab = \"Higher Unemployment 2021\",\n  ylab = \"Higher Unemployment 2011\",\n  size = 6\n)\n\n# combine, draw\nbivmap &lt;- ggdraw() +\n  draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n  draw_plot(legend, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3)\n\n# plot\nbivmap\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Lambeth 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we have now created a map of Lambeth. But what if we need to create a map for every borough in London? In R, you can create a basic function using the function() keyword, which allows you to encapsulate reusable code. A function can take arguments (inputs), perform operations, and return a result. A simple example of a function that adds two values together:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define function to add two numbers\nadd_numbers &lt;- function(a, b) {\n    result &lt;- a + b\n    return(result)\n}\n\n# use function\nadd_numbers(5, 3)\n\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nWe can use the same logic to construct a basic function that takes a spatial dataframe and the name of a borough as input and subsequently creates a bivarate map as output:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define function to create bivariate unemployment maps\ncreate_bivariate_map &lt;- function(spatial_df, borough_name) {\n  # select borough\n  spatial_df_filter &lt;- spatial_df |&gt;\n    filter(str_detect(lsoa21nm, borough_name))\n\n  # add classes\n  spatial_df_filter &lt;- spatial_df_filter |&gt;\n    bi_class(x = unemp21, y = unemp11, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3)\n\n  # bivariate map object\n  map &lt;- ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(\n      data = spatial_df_filter,\n      mapping = aes(fill = bi_class),\n      color = NA,\n      show.legend = FALSE\n    ) +\n    bi_scale_fill(\n      pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n      dim = 3\n    ) +\n    bi_theme()\n\n  # legend object\n  legend &lt;- bi_legend(\n    pal = \"DkBlue2\",\n    dim = 3,\n    xlab = \"Higher Unemployment 2021\",\n    ylab = \"Higher Unemployment 2011\",\n    size = 6\n  )\n\n  # combine\n  bivariate_map &lt;- ggdraw() +\n    draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +\n    draw_plot(legend, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.3)\n\n  # return value\n  return(bivariate_map)\n}\n\n\nWe can now use this function to quickly recreate maps for individual boroughs. Let’s try it for the London Borough of Hammersmith:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run function\ncreate_bivariate_map(lsoa21_sf, \"Hammersmith\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Hammersmith 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about Kensington and Chelsea? Or Wandsworth?\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run function\ncreate_bivariate_map(lsoa21_sf, \"Kensington and Chelsea\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Kensington and Chelsea 2011-2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run function\ncreate_bivariate_map(lsoa21_sf, \"Wandsworth\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Bivariate map of relative changes in unemployment rates in Wandsworth 2011-2021."

This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors, as you can simply call the function with different inputs, ensuring the same analysis steps are followed each time.\nHaving created a function to generate bivariate maps, we can now create a function for univariate maps. Using the dataset from the tutorial, try to:\n\nWrite a function with two parameters that uses the standard tmap library to map unemployment rates at the LSOA-level for a specified borough.\nAdd a third parameter that specifies which variable should be mapped (e.g., unemployment rates in 2011 or 2021).\nAdd a fourth parameter to define the colour palette to be used for the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like a more comprehensive introduction to writing your own functions in R, refer to Chapter 19: Functions in R for Data Science.

We can organise these scripts into RStudio projects, which consolidate all files related to an analysis such as input data, R scripts, results, figures, and more. This organisation helps keep track of all data, input, and output, while enabling us to create standalone scripts for each part of our analysis.\nNavigate to File -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory. Choose a directory name, such as GEOG0030, and select the location on your computer where you want to save this project by clicking on Browse…. Click on Create Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you select an appropriate folder to store your GEOG0030 project. For example, you might use your Geocomputation folder, if you have one, or another location within your Documents directory on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease ensure that folder names and file names do not contain spaces or special characters such as * . \" / \\ [ ] : ; | = , &lt; ? &gt; & $ # ! ' { } ( ). Different operating systems and programming languages deal differently with spaces and special characters and as such including these in your folder names and file names can cause many problems and unexpected errors. As an alternative to using white space you can use an underscore (_) or hyphen (-) if you like.\n\n\n\nYou should now see your main RStudio window switch to this new project and when you check your files pane, you should see a new R Project called GEOG0030.\nWith our GEOG0030 project ready to go, in this first tutorial we will look at the distribution of the share of European immigrants across London. The data covers the number of people residing in London that are born in a European country, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MSOA is a geographic unit used in the UK for statistical analysis. It typically represents small areas with populations of around 5,000 to 15,000 people and is designed to ensure consistent data reporting. MSOAs are commonly used to report on census data, deprivation indices, and other socio-economic statistics.\n\n\n\nThe dataset has been extracted using the Custom Dataset Tool, and you can download the file via the link provided below. Save the file in your project folder under data/attributes. Along with this dataset, we also have access to a GeoPackage that contains the MSOA boundaries. Save this file under data/spatial, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will to have create a folder named data within your RStudio Project directory, inside which you will have to have a folder named attributes and a folder named spatial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon MSOA Census 2021 European Population\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon MSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo download a csv file that is hosted on GitHub, click on the Download raw file button on the top right of your screen and it should download directly to your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have used spatial data before and noticed that we did not download a collection of files known as a shapefile but a GeoPackage instead. Whilst shapefiles are still being used, GeoPackage is a more modern and portable file format. Have a look at this article on towardsdatascience.com for an excellent explanation on why one should use GeoPackage files over shapefiles where possible: [Link]\n\n\n\nTo get started, let us create our first script. File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. Save your script as w01-european-population-london.r.\nWe will start by loading the libraries that we will need:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have to install some of these libraries if you have not used these before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Linux and macOS users who are new to working with spatial data in R, the installation of the sf library may fail because additional (non-R) libraries are required which are automatically installed for Windows users. If you encounter installation issues,, please refer to the information pages of the sf library for instructions on how to install these additional libraries.\n\n\n\nOnce downloaded, we can load both files into memory:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read spatial dataset\nmsoa21 &lt;- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n\n\nReading layer `London-MSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 1002 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n# load attribute dataset\nmsoa_eur &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/London-MSOA-European.csv\")\n\nRows: 1002 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): msoa21cd\ndbl (2): eur21, pop21\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# inspect\nhead(msoa21)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 530966.7 ymin: 180512.6 xmax: 551943.8 ymax: 191139\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n   msoa21cd                 msoa21nm msoa21nmw  bng_e  bng_n      lat      long\n1 E02000001       City of London 001           532384 181355 51.51562 -0.093490\n2 E02000002 Barking and Dagenham 001           548267 189685 51.58652  0.138756\n3 E02000003 Barking and Dagenham 002           548259 188520 51.57606  0.138149\n4 E02000004 Barking and Dagenham 003           551004 186412 51.55639  0.176828\n5 E02000005 Barking and Dagenham 004           548733 186824 51.56069  0.144267\n6 E02000007 Barking and Dagenham 006           549698 186609 51.55851  0.158087\n                                globalid                           geom\n1 {71249043-B176-4306-BA6C-D1A993B1B741} MULTIPOLYGON (((532135.1 18...\n2 {997A80A8-0EBE-461C-91EB-3E4122571A6E} MULTIPOLYGON (((548881.6 19...\n3 {62DED9D9-F53A-454D-AF35-04404D9DBE9B} MULTIPOLYGON (((549102.4 18...\n4 {511181CD-E71F-4C63-81EE-E8E76744A627} MULTIPOLYGON (((551550.1 18...\n5 {B0C823EB-69E0-4AE7-9E1C-37715CF3FE87} MULTIPOLYGON (((549099.6 18...\n6 {A33C6ADD-D70A-4737-ADE5-3460D7016CA1} MULTIPOLYGON (((549819.9 18...\n\n# inspect\nhead(msoa_eur)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  msoa21cd  eur21 pop21\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 E02000001  1926  8582\n2 E02000002  1102  8280\n3 E02000003  1930 11542\n4 E02000004   808  6640\n5 E02000005  1541 11082\n6 E02000007  1365 10159\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can further inspect both objects using the View() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we want to do when we load spatial data is to plot the data to check whether everything is in order.

Before proceeding with the join, we need to verify that a matching unique identifier exists in both datasets. Let’s look at the column names in our datasets again:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect column names\nnames(msoa21)\n\n\n[1] \"msoa21cd\"  \"msoa21nm\"  \"msoa21nmw\" \"bng_e\"     \"bng_n\"     \"lat\"      \n[7] \"long\"      \"globalid\"  \"geom\"     \n\n# inspect column names\nnames(msoa_eur)\n\n[1] \"msoa21cd\" \"eur21\"    \"pop21\"   \n\n\nThe msoa21cd columns looks promising as it features in both datasets. We can quickly sort both columns and have a peek at the data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect spatial dataset\nhead(sort(msoa21$msoa21cd))\n\n\n[1] \"E02000001\" \"E02000002\" \"E02000003\" \"E02000004\" \"E02000005\" \"E02000007\"\n\n# inspect attribute dataset\nhead(sort(msoa_eur$msoa21cd))\n\n[1] \"E02000001\" \"E02000002\" \"E02000003\" \"E02000004\" \"E02000005\" \"E02000007\"\n\n\nThey seem to contain similar values, so that is promising. Let us try to join the attribute data onto the spatial data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join attribute data onto spatial data\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt; \n  left_join(msoa_eur, by = c('msoa21cd' = 'msoa21cd'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code above uses a pipe function: |&gt;. The pipe operator allows you to pass the output of one function directly into the next, streamlining your code. While it might be a bit confusing at first, you will find that it makes your code faster to write and easier to read. More importantly, it reduces the need to create multiple intermediate variables to store outputs.\n\n\n\nWe can explore the joined data in usual fashion:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect columns\nncol(msoa21)\n\n\n[1] 11\n\n# inspect rows\nnrow(msoa21)\n\n[1] 1002\n\n# inspect data\nhead(msoa21)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 530966.7 ymin: 180512.6 xmax: 551943.8 ymax: 191139\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n   msoa21cd                 msoa21nm msoa21nmw  bng_e  bng_n      lat      long\n1 E02000001       City of London 001           532384 181355 51.51562 -0.093490\n2 E02000002 Barking and Dagenham 001           548267 189685 51.58652  0.138756\n3 E02000003 Barking and Dagenham 002           548259 188520 51.57606  0.138149\n4 E02000004 Barking and Dagenham 003           551004 186412 51.55639  0.176828\n5 E02000005 Barking and Dagenham 004           548733 186824 51.56069  0.144267\n6 E02000007 Barking and Dagenham 006           549698 186609 51.55851  0.158087\n                                globalid eur21 pop21\n1 {71249043-B176-4306-BA6C-D1A993B1B741}  1926  8582\n2 {997A80A8-0EBE-461C-91EB-3E4122571A6E}  1102  8280\n3 {62DED9D9-F53A-454D-AF35-04404D9DBE9B}  1930 11542\n4 {511181CD-E71F-4C63-81EE-E8E76744A627}   808  6640\n5 {B0C823EB-69E0-4AE7-9E1C-37715CF3FE87}  1541 11082\n6 {A33C6ADD-D70A-4737-ADE5-3460D7016CA1}  1365 10159\n                            geom\n1 MULTIPOLYGON (((532135.1 18...\n2 MULTIPOLYGON (((548881.6 19...\n3 MULTIPOLYGON (((549102.4 18...\n4 MULTIPOLYGON (((551550.1 18...\n5 MULTIPOLYGON (((549099.6 18...\n6 MULTIPOLYGON (((549819.9 18...\n\n# inspect column names\nnames(msoa21)\n\n [1] \"msoa21cd\"  \"msoa21nm\"  \"msoa21nmw\" \"bng_e\"     \"bng_n\"     \"lat\"      \n [7] \"long\"      \"globalid\"  \"eur21\"     \"pop21\"     \"geom\"     \n\n\nAlways inspect your join to ensure everything looks as expected. A good way to do this is by using the View() function to check for any unexpected missing values, which are marked as NA.\nWe can also compare the total number of rows in the spatial dataset with the total number of non-NA values in the joined columns:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\nnrow(msoa21)\n\n\n[1] 1002\n\n# check for missing values\nsum(!is.na(msoa21$eur21))\n\n[1] 1002\n\n# check for missing values\nsum(!is.na(msoa21$pop21))\n\n[1] 1002\n\n\nNo missing values. In this case we did not expect any missing values, so this confirms that all our full attribute dataset has been linked to the spatial dataset.\nWe are almost ready to map the data. Only thing that is left is for us to calculate the share of European-born immigrants within each MSOA:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# calculate proportion\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(prop_eur21 = eur21/pop21)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our map-making, we will use one of the two primary visualisation libraries for spatial data: tmap. tmap offers a flexible, layer-based approach that makes it easy to create various types of thematic maps, such as choropleths and proportional symbol maps. One of the standout features of tmap is its quick plotting function, qtm(), which allows you to generate basic maps with minimal effort.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# quick thematic map\nqtm(msoa21, fill = \"prop_eur21\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Quick thematic map.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the fill() argument in tmap is how we instruct the library to create a choropleth map based on the values in the specified column. If we set fill() to NULL, only the borders of our polygons will be drawn, without any colour fill. The qtm() function in tmap is versatile, allowing us to pass various parameters to customise the aesthetics of our map. By checking the function’s documentation, you can explore the full list of available parameters. For instance, to set the MSOA borders to white, we can use the borders parameter:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# quick thematic map\nqtm(msoa21, fill = \"prop_eur21\", col = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Quick thematic map with white borders.\n\n\n\n\nThe map does not look quite right yet. While we can continue tweaking parameters in the qtm() function to improve it, qtm() is somewhat limited in its functionality and is primarily intended for quickly inspecting your data and creating basic maps. For more complex and refined map-making with the tmap library, it is better to use the main plotting method that starts with the tm_shape() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary approach to creating maps in tmap involves using a layered grammar of graphics to build up your map, starting with the tm_shape() function. This function, when provided with a spatial dataframe, captures the spatial information of your data, including its projection and geometry, and creates a spatial object. While you can override certain aspects of the spatial data (such as its projection) using the function’s parameters, the essential role of tm_shape() is to instruct R to “use this object as the basis for drawing the shapes.”\nTo actually render the shapes, you need to add a layer that specifies the type of shape you want R to draw from this spatial information — such as polygons for our data. This layer function tells R to “draw my spatial object as X”, where X represents the type of shape. Within this layer, you can also provide additional details to control how R draws your shapes. Further, you can add more layers to include other spatial objects and their corresponding shapes on your map. Finally, layout options can be specified through a layout layer, allowing you to customise the overall appearance and arrangement of your map.\n\n\n\nLet us build a map using tmap:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Building up a map layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can now see, we have mapped the spatial polygons of our msoa21 spatial dataframe. However, this is not quite the map we want; we need a choropleth map where the polygons are coloured based on the proportion of European immigrants. To achieve this, we use the col parameter within the tm_polygons() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fill parameter within tm_polygons() allows you to fill polygons with colours based on:\n\nA single colour value (e.g. red or #fc9272).\nThe name of a data variable within the spatial data file. This variable can either contain specific colour values or numeric/categorical values that will be mapped to a colour palette.\n\n\n\n\nLet us go ahead and pass our prop_eur21 variable within the fill() parameter and see what we get:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"prop_eur21\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Building up a map layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\nWe are making progress, but there are two immediate issues with our map. First, the classification breaks do not adequately reflect the variation in our dataset. By default, tmap uses pretty breaks, which may not be the most effective for our data. An alternative, such as natural breaks (or jenks), might better reveal the data’s variation.\nTo customise the classification breaks, refer to the tm_polygons() documentation. The following parameters are relevant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfill.scale\nDefines the color scale for polygon fills. Accepts a scale object created by functions such as tm_scale_continuous() and tm_intervals()\n\n\ntm_scale_continuous()\nCreates a continuous scale object for mapping numeric values to colours. You can specify options such as palette (color scheme) and limits (data range).\n\n\ntm_scale_intervals()\nCreates a scale object for mapping data into discrete classes (intervals). Parameters include: n (number of classes) and style (classification method: e.g. quantile, equal, jenks)\n\n\n\nFor example, if we want to adjust our choropleth map to use five classes determined by the natural breaks method, we need to specify the n and style parameters as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"prop_eur21\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(n = 5, style = \"jenks\"),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Building up a map layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStyling a map in tmap requires a deeper understanding and familiarity with the library, which is something you will develop best through hands-on practice. Here are the key functions to be aware of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntm_layout()\nCustomises overall map layout, including titles, fonts, legend position, margins, and frame settings.\n\n\ntm_compass()\nAdds a compass or North arrow to the map, with options for size, position, and style.\n\n\ntm_scale_bar()\nAdds a scale bar to indicate distance, with options for units, position, and styling.\n\n\n\nTo begin styling your map, explore each of these functions and their parameters. Through trial and error, you can tweak and refine the map until you achieve the desired look:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"prop_eur21\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#feebe2\", \"#fbb4b9\", \"#f768a1\", \"#c51b8a\", \"#7a0177\"),\n      labels = c(\"Smallest share\", \"2nd smallest\", \"3rd smallest\", \"4th smallest\", \"Largest share\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Share of population\",\n      na.text = \"No population\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n\n  # title\n  tm_title(\n    text = \"Share of population born in Europe\"\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.90, 1.00),\n    legend.title.size = 0.8,\n    legend.title.fontface = \"bold\",\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    inner.margins = c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05),\n    frame = FALSE,\n  ) +\n\n  # North arrow\n  tm_compass(\n    type = \"arrow\",\n    position = c(\"left\", \"top\"),\n    size = 1,\n    text.size = 0.7\n  ) +\n\n  # scale bar\n  tm_scalebar(\n    breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20),\n    position = c(0.85, 0.20),\n    text.size = 0.4\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Building up a map layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\nWe can also have some map labels, if we want, by extracting centroids from selected polygons and adding these as separate map layer:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# map labels\nlab &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n  filter(msoa21cd == \"E02000642\" | msoa21cd == \"E02000180\") |&gt;\n  st_centroid()\n\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\n# map object\nlon_eurpop &lt;-\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"prop_eur21\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#feebe2\", \"#fbb4b9\", \"#f768a1\", \"#c51b8a\", \"#7a0177\"),\n      labels = c(\"Smallest share\", \"2nd smallest\", \"3rd smallest\", \"4th smallest\", \"Largest share\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Share of population\",\n      na.text = \"No population\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(lab) +\n\n  # centroids\n  tm_symbols(\n    size = 0.4,\n    col = \"#000000\",\n    fill = \"#000000\"\n  ) +\n\n  # labels\n  tm_text(\n    text = \"msoa21nm\",\n    col = \"#000000\",\n    size = 0.8,\n    xmod = 0,\n    ymod = -0.8,\n    bgcol = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    bgcol_alpha = 0.5\n  ) +\n\n  # title\n  tm_title(\n    text = \"Share of population born in Europe\"\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.90, 1.00),\n    legend.title.size = 0.8,\n    legend.title.fontface = \"bold\",\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    inner.margins = c(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05),\n    frame = FALSE,\n  ) +\n\n  # North arrow\n  tm_compass(\n    type = \"arrow\",\n    position = c(\"left\", \"top\"),\n    size = 1,\n    text.size = 0.7\n  ) +\n\n  # scale bar\n  tm_scalebar(\n    breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20),\n    position = c(0.85, 0.20),\n    text.size = 0.4\n  )\n\n# plot\nlon_eurpop\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Building up a map layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\nIn the code above, we stored the full map definition as an object. This makes it easy to export the map and save it as a .jpg, .png or .pdf file:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# write map\ntmap_save(tm = lon_eurpop, filename = \"london-european-population.jpg\", width = 15,\n    height = 15, units = c(\"cm\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have prepared our dataset and created our initial maps in R, we can also try and map the distribution of the proportion of European immigrants across Wales and experiment with different mapping parameters. Follow these steps:\n\nDownload the two datasets provided below and save them in the appropriate subfolder within your data directory. The datasets include:\n\nA csv file containing the number of people residing in Wales that are born in a European country, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the MSOA level.\nA GeoPackage file containing the 2021 MSOA spatial boundaries for England and Wales.\n\nLoad both datasets and merge them together. Make sure to only retain those MSOAs that belong to Wales.\nCreate a map that shows the proportion of the population residing in Wales that is born in Europe.\nExperiment by adjusting various map parameters, such as the colour scheme, map labels, and data classification method.\n\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nWales MSOA Census 2021 European Population\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nEngland and Wales MSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that is how you use R as a GIS in its most basic form. More RGIS in the coming weeks, but this concludes the tutorial for this week."

    "text": "In RStudio, scripts allow us to build and save code that can be run repeatedly. We can organise these scripts into RStudio projects, which consolidate all files related to an analysis such as input data, R scripts, results, figures, and more. This organisation helps keep track of all data, input, and output, while enabling us to create standalone scripts for each part of our analysis.\nNavigate to File -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory. Choose a directory name, such as GEOG0030, and select the location on your computer where you want to save this project by clicking on Browse…. Click on Create Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you select an appropriate folder to store your GEOG0030 project. For example, you might use your Geocomputation folder, if you have one, or another location within your Documents directory on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease ensure that folder names and file names do not contain spaces or special characters such as * . \" / \\ [ ] : ; | = , &lt; ? &gt; & $ # ! ' { } ( ). Different operating systems and programming languages deal differently with spaces and special characters and as such including these in your folder names and file names can cause many problems and unexpected errors. As an alternative to using white space you can use an underscore (_) or hyphen (-) if you like.\n\n\n\nYou should now see your main RStudio window switch to this new project and when you check your files pane, you should see a new R Project called GEOG0030.\nWith our GEOG0030 project ready to go, in this first tutorial we will look at the distribution of the share of European immigrants across London. The data covers the number of people residing in London that are born in a European country, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn MSOA is a geographic unit used in the UK for statistical analysis. It typically represents small areas with populations of around 5,000 to 15,000 people and is designed to ensure consistent data reporting. MSOAs are commonly used to report on census data, deprivation indices, and other socio-economic statistics.\n\n\n\nThe dataset has been extracted using the Custom Dataset Tool, and you can download the file via the link provided below. Save the file in your project folder under data/attributes. Along with this dataset, we also have access to a GeoPackage that contains the MSOA boundaries. Save this file under data/spatial, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will to have create a folder named data within your RStudio Project directory, inside which you will have to have a folder named attributes and a folder named spatial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon MSOA Census 2021 European Population\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon MSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo download a csv file that is hosted on GitHub, click on the Download raw file button on the top right of your screen and it should download directly to your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have used spatial data before and noticed that we did not download a collection of files known as a shapefile but a GeoPackage instead. Whilst shapefiles are still being used, GeoPackage is a more modern and portable file format. Have a look at this article on towardsdatascience.com for an excellent explanation on why one should use GeoPackage files over shapefiles where possible: [Link]\n\n\n\nTo get started, let us create our first script.

Before proceeding with the join, we need to verify that a matching unique identifier exists in both datasets. Let’s look at the column names in our datasets again:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect column names\nnames(msoa21)\n\n\n[1] \"msoa21cd\"  \"msoa21nm\"  \"msoa21nmw\" \"bng_e\"     \"bng_n\"     \"lat\"      \n[7] \"long\"      \"globalid\"  \"geom\"     \n\n# inspect column names\nnames(msoa_eur)\n\n[1] \"msoa21cd\" \"eur21\"    \"pop21\"   \n\n\nThe msoa21cd columns looks promising as it features in both datasets. We can quickly sort both columns and have a peek at the data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect spatial dataset\nhead(sort(msoa21$msoa21cd))\n\n\n[1] \"E02000001\" \"E02000002\" \"E02000003\" \"E02000004\" \"E02000005\" \"E02000007\"\n\n# inspect attribute dataset\nhead(sort(msoa_eur$msoa21cd))\n\n[1] \"E02000001\" \"E02000002\" \"E02000003\" \"E02000004\" \"E02000005\" \"E02000007\"\n\n\nThey seem to contain similar values, so that is promising. Let us try to join the attribute data onto the spatial data:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join attribute data onto spatial data\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt; \n  left_join(msoa_eur, by = c('msoa21cd' = 'msoa21cd'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code above uses a pipe function: |&gt;. The pipe operator allows you to pass the output of one function directly into the next, streamlining your code. While it might be a bit confusing at first, you will find that it makes your code faster to write and easier to read. More importantly, it reduces the need to create multiple intermediate variables to store outputs.\n\n\n\nWe can explore the joined data in usual fashion:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect columns\nncol(msoa21)\n\n\n[1] 11\n\n# inspect rows\nnrow(msoa21)\n\n[1] 1002\n\n# inspect data\nhead(msoa21)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 530966.7 ymin: 180512.6 xmax: 551943.8 ymax: 191139\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n   msoa21cd                 msoa21nm msoa21nmw  bng_e  bng_n      lat      long\n1 E02000001       City of London 001           532384 181355 51.51562 -0.093490\n2 E02000002 Barking and Dagenham 001           548267 189685 51.58652  0.138756\n3 E02000003 Barking and Dagenham 002           548259 188520 51.57606  0.138149\n4 E02000004 Barking and Dagenham 003           551004 186412 51.55639  0.176828\n5 E02000005 Barking and Dagenham 004           548733 186824 51.56069  0.144267\n6 E02000007 Barking and Dagenham 006           549698 186609 51.55851  0.158087\n                                globalid eur21 pop21\n1 {71249043-B176-4306-BA6C-D1A993B1B741}  1926  8582\n2 {997A80A8-0EBE-461C-91EB-3E4122571A6E}  1102  8280\n3 {62DED9D9-F53A-454D-AF35-04404D9DBE9B}  1930 11542\n4 {511181CD-E71F-4C63-81EE-E8E76744A627}   808  6640\n5 {B0C823EB-69E0-4AE7-9E1C-37715CF3FE87}  1541 11082\n6 {A33C6ADD-D70A-4737-ADE5-3460D7016CA1}  1365 10159\n                            geom\n1 MULTIPOLYGON (((532135.1 18...\n2 MULTIPOLYGON (((548881.6 19...\n3 MULTIPOLYGON (((549102.4 18...\n4 MULTIPOLYGON (((551550.1 18...\n5 MULTIPOLYGON (((549099.6 18...\n6 MULTIPOLYGON (((549819.9 18...\n\n# inspect column names\nnames(msoa21)\n\n [1] \"msoa21cd\"  \"msoa21nm\"  \"msoa21nmw\" \"bng_e\"     \"bng_n\"     \"lat\"      \n [7] \"long\"      \"globalid\"  \"eur21\"     \"pop21\"     \"geom\"     \n\n\nAlways inspect your join to ensure everything looks as expected. A good way to do this is by using the View() function to check for any unexpected missing values, which are marked as NA.\nWe can also compare the total number of rows in the spatial dataset with the total number of non-NA values in the joined columns:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\nnrow(msoa21)\n\n\n[1] 1002\n\n# check for missing values\nsum(!is.na(msoa21$eur21))\n\n[1] 1002\n\n# check for missing values\nsum(!is.na(msoa21$pop21))\n\n[1] 1002\n\n\nNo missing values. In this case we did not expect any missing values, so this confirms that all our full attribute dataset has been linked to the spatial dataset.\nWe are almost ready to map the data. Only thing that is left is for us to calculate the share of European-born immigrants within each MSOA:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# calculate proportion\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(prop_eur21 = eur21/pop21)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our map-making, we will use one of the two primary visualisation libraries for spatial data: tmap. tmap offers a flexible, layer-based approach that makes it easy to create various types of thematic maps, such as choropleths and proportional symbol maps. One of the standout features of tmap is its quick plotting function, qtm(), which allows you to generate basic maps with minimal effort.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# quick thematic map\nqtm(msoa21, fill = \"prop_eur21\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Quick thematic map.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the fill() argument in tmap is how we instruct the library to create a choropleth map based on the values in the specified column. If we set fill() to NULL, only the borders of our polygons will be drawn, without any colour fill. The qtm() function in tmap is versatile, allowing us to pass various parameters to customise the aesthetics of our map. By checking the function’s documentation, you can explore the full list of available parameters. For instance, to set the MSOA borders to white, we can use the borders parameter:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# quick thematic map\nqtm(msoa21, fill = \"prop_eur21\", col = \"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Quick thematic map with white borders.\n\n\n\n\nThe map does not look quite right yet. While we can continue tweaking parameters in the qtm() function to improve it, qtm() is somewhat limited in its functionality and is primarily intended for quickly inspecting your data and creating basic maps. For more complex and refined map-making with the tmap library, it is better to use the main plotting method that starts with the tm_shape() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary approach to creating maps in tmap involves using a layered grammar of graphics to build up your map, starting with the tm_shape() function. This function, when provided with a spatial dataframe, captures the spatial information of your data, including its projection and geometry, and creates a spatial object. While you can override certain aspects of the spatial data (such as its projection) using the function’s parameters, the essential role of tm_shape() is to instruct R to “use this object as the basis for drawing the shapes.”\nTo actually render the shapes, you need to add a layer that specifies the type of shape you want R to draw from this spatial information — such as polygons for our data. This layer function tells R to “draw my spatial object as X”, where X represents the type of shape. Within this layer, you can also provide additional details to control how R draws your shapes. Further, you can add more layers to include other spatial objects and their corresponding shapes on your map. Finally, layout options can be specified through a layout layer, allowing you to customise the overall appearance and arrangement of your map.\n\n\n\nLet us build a map using tmap:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Building up a map layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can now see, we have mapped the spatial polygons of our msoa21 spatial dataframe. However, this is not quite the map we want; we need a choropleth map where the polygons are coloured based on the proportion of European immigrants. To achieve this, we use the col parameter within the tm_polygons() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fill parameter within tm_polygons() allows you to fill polygons with colours based on:\n\nA single colour value (e.g. red or #fc9272).\nThe name of a data variable within the spatial data file. This variable can either contain specific colour values or numeric/categorical values that will be mapped to a colour palette.\n\n\n\n\nLet us go ahead and pass our prop_eur21 variable within the fill() parameter and see what we get:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"prop_eur21\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Building up a map layer by layer.\n\n\n\n\nWe are making progress, but there are two immediate issues with our map. First, the classification breaks do not adequately reflect the variation in our dataset. By default, tmap uses pretty breaks, which may not be the most effective for our data. An alternative, such as natural breaks (or jenks), might better reveal the data’s variation.\nTo customise the classification breaks, refer to the tm_polygons() documentation. The following parameters are relevant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfill.scale\nDefines the color scale for polygon fills. Accepts a scale object created by functions such as tm_scale_continuous() and tm_intervals()\n\n\ntm_scale_continuous()\nCreates a continuous scale object for mapping numeric values to colours. You can specify options such as palette (color scheme) and limits (data range).\n\n\ntm_scale_intervals()\nCreates a scale object for mapping data into discrete classes (intervals). Parameters include: n (number of classes) and style (classification method: e.g. quantile, equal, jenks)\n\n\n\nFor example, if we want to adjust our choropleth map to use five classes determined by the natural breaks method, we need to specify the n and style parameters as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"prop_eur21\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(n = 5, style = \"jenks\"),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Building up a map layer by layer."

Before diving into PPA, we will aggregate the bicycle thefts to the MSOA level to map their distribution by using a point-in-polygon approach.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# point in polygon\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(theft_bike_n = lengths(st_intersects(msoa21, theft_bike, sparse = TRUE)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a point-in-polygon count within sf, we use the st_intersects() function and keep its default sparse = TRUE output, which produces a list of intersecting points by index for each polygon (e.g. MSOA). We then apply the lengths() function to count the number of points intersecting each polygon, giving us the total number of bike thefts per MSOA.\n\n\n\nWe can now calculate the area of each MSOA and, combined with the total number of bicycle thefts, determine the number of thefts per square kilometre. This involves calculating the size of each MSOA in square kilometres and then dividing the total number of thefts by this area to get a theft density measure.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# msoa area size\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(km_sq = as.numeric(st_area(msoa21))/1e+06)\n\n# theft density\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(thef_km_sq = theft_bike_n/km_sq)\n\n\nLet’s put this onto a map:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"thef_km_sq\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#fee5d9\", \"#fcae91\", \"#fb6a4a\", \"#de2d26\", \"#a50f15\")\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Share of population\",\n      na.text = \"No population\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.title.size = 0.8,\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n    legend.position = c(0.8, 0.35),\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of reported bicycle thefts by square kilometre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that the number of bicycle thefts is clearly concentrated in parts of Central London. While this map may provide helpful insights, its representation depends on the classification and aggregation of the underlying data. Alternatively, we can directly analyse the point events themselves. For this, we will use the spatstat library, the primary library for point pattern analysis in R. To use spatstat, we need to convert our data into a ppp object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ppp format is specific to spatstat but is also used in some other spatial analysis libraries. A ppp object represents a two-dimensional point dataset within a defined area, called the window of observation (owin in spatstat). We can either create a ppp object directly from a list of coordinates (with a specified window of observation) or convert it from another data type.\n\n\n\nWe can turn our theft_bike dataframe into a ppp object as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# london outline\noutline &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    st_union()\n\n# clip\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_intersection(outline)\n\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n# sf to ppp\nwindow = as.owin(msoa21)\ntheft_bike_ppp &lt;- ppp(st_coordinates(theft_bike)[, 1], st_coordinates(theft_bike)[,\n    2], window = window)\n\nWarning: data contain duplicated points\n\n# inspect\npar(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))\nplot(theft_bike_ppp, main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bike theft in London represented as ppp object.\n\n\n\n\nSome statistical procedures require point events to be unique. In our bicycle theft data, duplicates are likely due to the police snapping points to protect anonymity and privacy. This can pose an issue for spatial point pattern analysis, where each theft and its location must be distinct. We can check whether we have any duplicated points as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# check for duplicates\nanyDuplicated(theft_bike_ppp)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# count number of duplicated points\nsum(multiplicity(theft_bike_ppp) &gt; 1)\n\n[1] 10003\n\n\nTo address this, we have three options:\n\nRemove duplicates if the number of duplicated points is small or the exact location is less important than the overall distribution.\nAssign weights to points, where each has an attribute indicating the number of events at that location rather than being recorded as separate event.\nAdd jitter by slightly offsetting the points randomly, which can be useful if precise location is not crucial for the analysis.\n\nEach approach has its own trade-offs, depending on the analysis. In our case, we will use the jitter approach to retain all bike theft events. Since the locations are already approximated, adding a small offset (~5 metre) will not impact the analysis.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# add ajitter\ntheft_bike_jitter &lt;- rjitter(theft_bike_ppp, radius = 5, retry = TRUE, nsim = 1,\n    drop = TRUE)\n\n# check for duplicates\nanyDuplicated(theft_bike_jitter)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# count number of duplicated points\nsum(multiplicity(theft_bike_jitter) &gt; 1)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThis seemed to have worked, so we can move forward.\n\n\nInstead of visualising the distribution of bike thefts at a specific geographical level, we can use Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to display the distribution of these incidents. KDE is a statistical method that creates a smooth, continuous distribution to represent the density of the underlying pattern between data points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE) generates a raster surface that shows the estimated density of event points across space. Each cell represents the local density, highlighting areas of high or low concentration. KDE uses overlapping moving windows (defined by a kernel) and a bandwidth parameter, which controls the size of the window, influencing the smoothness of the resulting density surface. The kernel function can assign equal or weighted values to points, producing a grid of density values based on these local calculations.\n\n\n\nLet’s go ahead and create a simple KDE of bike theft with our bandwidth set to 500 metres:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# kernel density estimation\npar(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))\nplot(density.ppp(theft_bike_jitter, sigma = 500), main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Kernel density estimation - bandwidth 500m.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from just our KDE that there are visible clusters present within our bike theft data, particularly in and around Central London. We can go ahead and increase the bandwidth to to see how that affects the density estimate:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# kernel density estimation\npar(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))\nplot(density.ppp(theft_bike_jitter, sigma = 1000), main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Kernel density estimation - bandwidth 1000m.\n\n\n\n\nBy increasing the bandwidth, our clusters appear larger and brighter than with the 500-metre bandwidth. A larger bandwidth considers more points, resulting in a smoother surface. However, this can lead to oversmoothing, where clusters become less defined, potentially overestimating areas of high bike theft. Smaller bandwidths offer more precision and sharper clusters but risk undersmoothing, which can cause irregularities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile automated methods (e.g. maximum-likelihood estimation) can assist in selecting an optimal bandwidth, the choice is subjective and depends on the specific characteristics of your dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough bandwidth has a greater impact on density estimation than the kernel type, the choice of kernel can still influence the results by altering how points are weighted within the window. We will explore kernel types a little further when we discuss spatial models in a few weeks time.\n\n\n\nOnce we are satisfied with our KDE visualisation, we can create a proper map by converting the KDE output into raster format.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to raster\ntheft_bike_raster &lt;- density.ppp(theft_bike_jitter, sigma = 1000) |&gt;\n    rast()\n\n\nWe now have a standalone raster that we can use with any function in the tmap library. However, one issue is that the resulting raster lacks a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), so we need to manually assign this information to the raster object:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# set CRS\ncrs(theft_bike_raster) &lt;- \"EPSG:27700\"\n\n\nNow we can map the KDE values.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(theft_bike_raster) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_raster(\n    # map data\n    col = \"lyr.1\",\n    col.scale = tm_scale(\n      values = \"brewer.blues\"\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    col.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Density\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    )\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.8, 0.35),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Kernel Density Estimate of bicycle thefts in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values of the KDE output are stored in the raster grid as lyr.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density Estimation is a useful exploratory technique for identifying spatial clusters in point data, but it does not provide precise boundaries for these clusters. To more accurately delineate clusters, we can use an algorithm called DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), which takes both distance and density into account. DBSCAN is effective at discovering distinct clusters by grouping together points that are close to one another while marking points that don’t belong to any cluster as noise.\nDBSCAN requires two parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nepsilon\nThe maximum distance for points to be considered in the same cluster.\n\n\nminPts\nThe minimum number of points for a cluster.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm groups nearby points based on these parameters and marks low-density points as outliers. DBSCAN is useful for uncovering patterns that are difficult to detect visually, but it works best when clusters have consistent densities.\nLet us try this with an epsilon of 200 metres and minPts of 20 bicycle thefts:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# dbscan\nbike_theft_dbscan &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_coordinates() |&gt;\n    dbscan(eps = 200, minPts = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dbscan() function accepts a data matrix or dataframe of points, not a spatial dataframe. That is why, in the code above, we use the st_coordinates() function to extract the projected coordinates from the spatial dataframe.\n\n\n\nThe DBSCAN output includes three objects, one of which is a vector detailing the cluster each bike theft observation has been assigned to. To work with this output effectively, we need to add the cluster labels back to the original point dataset. Since DBSCAN does not alter the order of points, we can simply add the cluster output to the theft_bike spatial dataframe.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# add cluster numbers\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    mutate(dbcluster = bike_theft_dbscan$cluster)\n\n\nNow that each bike theft point in London is associated with a specific cluster, where appropriate, we can generate a polygon representing these clusters. To do this, we will use the st_convex_hull() function from the sf package, which creates a polygon that covers the minimum bounding area of a collection of points. We will apply this function to each cluster using a for loop, which allows us to repeat the process for each group of points and create a polygon representing the geometry of each cluster.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create an empty list to store the resulting convex hull geometries set the\n# length of this list to the total number of clusters found\ngeometry_list &lt;- vector(mode = \"list\", length = max(theft_bike$dbcluster))\n\n# begin loop\nfor (cluster_index in seq(1, max(theft_bike$dbcluster))) {\n\n    # filter to only return points for belonging to cluster n\n    theft_bike_subset &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n        filter(dbcluster == cluster_index)\n\n    # union points, calculate convex hull\n    cluster_polygon &lt;- theft_bike_subset |&gt;\n        st_union() |&gt;\n        st_convex_hull()\n\n    # add the geometry of the polygon to our list\n    geometry_list[cluster_index] &lt;- (cluster_polygon)\n\n}\n\n# combine the list\ntheft_bike_clusters &lt;- st_sfc(geometry_list, crs = 27700)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile loops in R should generally be avoided for large datasets due to inefficiency, they remain a useful tool for automating repetitive tasks and reducing the risk of errors. For smaller datasets or tasks that cannot easily be vectorised, loops can still be effective and simplify the code.\n\n\n\nWe now have a spatial dataframe that contains the bike theft clusters in London, as defined by the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Let’s quickly map these clusters:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    size = 0.10,\n    fill = \"#636363\",\n    col = \"#636363\",\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike_clusters) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"#fdc086\",\n    fill = \"#fdc086\",\n    fill_alpha = 0.7\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    frame = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: DBSCAN-identified clusters of reported bicycle theft in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we know how to work with point locatoin data, we can again apply a similar analysis to road crashes in London in 2022 that we used last week. This time we will use this dataset to assess whether road crashes cluster in specific areas. Try the following:\n\nCreate a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of all road crashes that occurred in London in 2022.\nUsing DBSCAN output, create a cluster map of serious and fatal road crashes in London\n\nIf you no longer have a copy of the 2022 London STATS19 Road Collision dataset, you can download it using the link provided below.\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon STATS19 Road Collisions 2022\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith access to point event data, geographers aim to identify underlying patterns.

Before diving into PPA, we will aggregate the bicycle thefts to the MSOA level to map their distribution by using a point-in-polygon approach.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# point in polygon\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(theft_bike_n = lengths(st_intersects(msoa21, theft_bike, sparse = TRUE)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a point-in-polygon count within sf, we use the st_intersects() function and keep its default sparse = TRUE output, which produces a list of intersecting points by index for each polygon (e.g. MSOA). We then apply the lengths() function to count the number of points intersecting each polygon, giving us the total number of bike thefts per MSOA.\n\n\n\nWe can now calculate the area of each MSOA and, combined with the total number of bicycle thefts, determine the number of thefts per square kilometre. This involves calculating the size of each MSOA in square kilometres and then dividing the total number of thefts by this area to get a theft density measure.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# msoa area size\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(km_sq = as.numeric(st_area(msoa21))/1e+06)\n\n# theft density\nmsoa21 &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    mutate(thef_km_sq = theft_bike_n/km_sq)\n\n\nLet’s put this onto a map:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"thef_km_sq\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#fee5d9\", \"#fcae91\", \"#fb6a4a\", \"#de2d26\", \"#a50f15\")\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Share of population\",\n      na.text = \"No population\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.title.size = 0.8,\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n    legend.position = c(0.8, 0.35),\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Number of reported bicycle thefts by square kilometre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that the number of bicycle thefts is clearly concentrated in parts of Central London. While this map may provide helpful insights, its representation depends on the classification and aggregation of the underlying data. Alternatively, we can directly analyse the point events themselves. For this, we will use the spatstat library, the primary library for point pattern analysis in R. To use spatstat, we need to convert our data into a ppp object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ppp format is specific to spatstat but is also used in some other spatial analysis libraries. A ppp object represents a two-dimensional point dataset within a defined area, called the window of observation (owin in spatstat). We can either create a ppp object directly from a list of coordinates (with a specified window of observation) or convert it from another data type.\n\n\n\nWe can turn our theft_bike dataframe into a ppp object as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# london outline\noutline &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n    st_union()\n\n# clip\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_intersection(outline)\n\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n# sf to ppp\nwindow = as.owin(msoa21)\ntheft_bike_ppp &lt;- ppp(st_coordinates(theft_bike)[, 1], st_coordinates(theft_bike)[,\n    2], window = window)\n\nWarning: data contain duplicated points\n\n# inspect\npar(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))\nplot(theft_bike_ppp, main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bike theft in London represented as ppp object.\n\n\n\n\nSome statistical procedures require point events to be unique. In our bicycle theft data, duplicates are likely due to the police snapping points to protect anonymity and privacy. This can pose an issue for spatial point pattern analysis, where each theft and its location must be distinct. We can check whether we have any duplicated points as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# check for duplicates\nanyDuplicated(theft_bike_ppp)\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# count number of duplicated points\nsum(multiplicity(theft_bike_ppp) &gt; 1)\n\n[1] 10003\n\n\nTo address this, we have three options:\n\nRemove duplicates if the number of duplicated points is small or the exact location is less important than the overall distribution.\nAssign weights to points, where each has an attribute indicating the number of events at that location rather than being recorded as separate event.\nAdd jitter by slightly offsetting the points randomly, which can be useful if precise location is not crucial for the analysis.\n\nEach approach has its own trade-offs, depending on the analysis. In our case, we will use the jitter approach to retain all bike theft events. Since the locations are already approximated, adding a small offset (~5 metre) will not impact the analysis.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# add ajitter\ntheft_bike_jitter &lt;- rjitter(theft_bike_ppp, radius = 5, retry = TRUE, nsim = 1,\n    drop = TRUE)\n\n# check for duplicates\nanyDuplicated(theft_bike_jitter)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# count number of duplicated points\nsum(multiplicity(theft_bike_jitter) &gt; 1)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThis seemed to have worked, so we can move forward.\n\n\nInstead of visualising the distribution of bike thefts at a specific geographical level, we can use Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to display the distribution of these incidents. KDE is a statistical method that creates a smooth, continuous distribution to represent the density of the underlying pattern between data points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE) generates a raster surface that shows the estimated density of event points across space. Each cell represents the local density, highlighting areas of high or low concentration. KDE uses overlapping moving windows (defined by a kernel) and a bandwidth parameter, which controls the size of the window, influencing the smoothness of the resulting density surface. The kernel function can assign equal or weighted values to points, producing a grid of density values based on these local calculations.\n\n\n\nLet’s go ahead and create a simple KDE of bike theft with our bandwidth set to 500 metres:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# kernel density estimation\npar(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))\nplot(density.ppp(theft_bike_jitter, sigma = 500), main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Kernel density estimation - bandwidth 500m.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from just our KDE that there are visible clusters present within our bike theft data, particularly in and around Central London. We can go ahead and increase the bandwidth to to see how that affects the density estimate:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# kernel density estimation\npar(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))\nplot(density.ppp(theft_bike_jitter, sigma = 1000), main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Kernel density estimation - bandwidth 1000m.\n\n\n\n\nBy increasing the bandwidth, our clusters appear larger and brighter than with the 500-metre bandwidth. A larger bandwidth considers more points, resulting in a smoother surface. However, this can lead to oversmoothing, where clusters become less defined, potentially overestimating areas of high bike theft. Smaller bandwidths offer more precision and sharper clusters but risk undersmoothing, which can cause irregularities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile automated methods (e.g. maximum-likelihood estimation) can assist in selecting an optimal bandwidth, the choice is subjective and depends on the specific characteristics of your dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough bandwidth has a greater impact on density estimation than the kernel type, the choice of kernel can still influence the results by altering how points are weighted within the window. We will explore kernel types a little further when we discuss spatial models in a few weeks time.\n\n\n\nOnce we are satisfied with our KDE visualisation, we can create a proper map by converting the KDE output into raster format.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to raster\ntheft_bike_raster &lt;- density.ppp(theft_bike_jitter, sigma = 1000) |&gt;\n    rast()\n\n\nWe now have a standalone raster that we can use with any function in the tmap library. However, one issue is that the resulting raster lacks a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), so we need to manually assign this information to the raster object:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# set CRS\ncrs(theft_bike_raster) &lt;- \"EPSG:27700\"\n\n\nNow we can map the KDE values.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(theft_bike_raster) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_raster(\n    # map data\n    col = \"lyr.1\",\n    col.scale = tm_scale(\n      values = \"brewer.blues\"\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    col.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Density\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    )\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.8, 0.35),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Kernel Density Estimate of bicycle thefts in London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values of the KDE output are stored in the raster grid as lyr.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKernel Density Estimation is a useful exploratory technique for identifying spatial clusters in point data, but it does not provide precise boundaries for these clusters. To more accurately delineate clusters, we can use an algorithm called DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), which takes both distance and density into account. DBSCAN is effective at discovering distinct clusters by grouping together points that are close to one another while marking points that don’t belong to any cluster as noise.\nDBSCAN requires two parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nepsilon\nThe maximum distance for points to be considered in the same cluster.\n\n\nminPts\nThe minimum number of points for a cluster.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm groups nearby points based on these parameters and marks low-density points as outliers. DBSCAN is useful for uncovering patterns that are difficult to detect visually, but it works best when clusters have consistent densities.\nLet us try this with an epsilon of 200 metres and minPts of 20 bicycle thefts:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# dbscan\nbike_theft_dbscan &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_coordinates() |&gt;\n    dbscan(eps = 200, minPts = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dbscan() function accepts a data matrix or dataframe of points, not a spatial dataframe. That is why, in the code above, we use the st_coordinates() function to extract the projected coordinates from the spatial dataframe.\n\n\n\nThe DBSCAN output includes three objects, one of which is a vector detailing the cluster each bike theft observation has been assigned to. To work with this output effectively, we need to add the cluster labels back to the original point dataset. Since DBSCAN does not alter the order of points, we can simply add the cluster output to the theft_bike spatial dataframe.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# add cluster numbers\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    mutate(dbcluster = bike_theft_dbscan$cluster)\n\n\nNow that each bike theft point in London is associated with a specific cluster, where appropriate, we can generate a polygon representing these clusters. To do this, we will use the st_convex_hull() function from the sf package, which creates a polygon that covers the minimum bounding area of a collection of points. We will apply this function to each cluster using a for loop, which allows us to repeat the process for each group of points and create a polygon representing the geometry of each cluster.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create an empty list to store the resulting convex hull geometries set the\n# length of this list to the total number of clusters found\ngeometry_list &lt;- vector(mode = \"list\", length = max(theft_bike$dbcluster))\n\n# begin loop\nfor (cluster_index in seq(1, max(theft_bike$dbcluster))) {\n\n    # filter to only return points for belonging to cluster n\n    theft_bike_subset &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n        filter(dbcluster == cluster_index)\n\n    # union points, calculate convex hull\n    cluster_polygon &lt;- theft_bike_subset |&gt;\n        st_union() |&gt;\n        st_convex_hull()\n\n    # add the geometry of the polygon to our list\n    geometry_list[cluster_index] &lt;- (cluster_polygon)\n\n}\n\n# combine the list\ntheft_bike_clusters &lt;- st_sfc(geometry_list, crs = 27700)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile loops in R should generally be avoided for large datasets due to inefficiency, they remain a useful tool for automating repetitive tasks and reducing the risk of errors. For smaller datasets or tasks that cannot easily be vectorised, loops can still be effective and simplify the code.\n\n\n\nWe now have a spatial dataframe that contains the bike theft clusters in London, as defined by the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Let’s quickly map these clusters:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    size = 0.10,\n    fill = \"#636363\",\n    col = \"#636363\",\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike_clusters) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"#fdc086\",\n    fill = \"#fdc086\",\n    fill_alpha = 0.7\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    frame = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: DBSCAN-identified clusters of reported bicycle theft in London."

We will use OpenStreetMap to extract road segment data. Similar to the POI dataset, OSM uses key and value tags to categorise the features within its dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map of the world, but its coverage is uneven globally. However, the accuracy and quality of the data can at times be questionable, with details such as road types and speed limits missing. The OpenStreetMap Wiki provides more details on the tagging system.\n\n\n\nTo download the Lambeth road network dataset, we first need to define our bounding box coordinates. We will then use these coordinates in our OSM query to extract specific types of road segments within the defined search area. Our focus will be on selecting all OSM features with the highway tag that are likely to be used by pedestrians (e.g. excluding motorways).\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define our bbox coordinates, use WGS84\nbbox_lambeth &lt;- poi24 |&gt;\n    st_transform(4326) |&gt;\n    st_bbox()\n\n# osm query\nosm_network &lt;- opq(bbox = bbox_lambeth) |&gt;\n    add_osm_feature(key = \"highway\", value = c(\"primary\", \"secondary\", \"tertiary\",\n        \"residential\", \"path\", \"footway\", \"unclassified\", \"living_street\", \"pedestrian\")) |&gt;\n    osmdata_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the OSM query may return an error, particularly when multiple users from the same location are executing the exact same query. If so, you can download a prepared copy of the data here: [Download]. You can load this copy into R through load('data/spatial/London-OSM-Roads.RData')\n\n\n\nThe returned osm_network object contains a variety of elements with the specified tags. Our next step is to extract the spatial data from this object to create our road network dataset. Specifically, we will extract the edges of the network, which represent the lines of the roads, as well as the nodes, which represent the points where the roads start, end, or intersect.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract the nodes, with their osm_id\nosm_network_nodes &lt;- osm_network$osm_points[, \"osm_id\"]\n\n# extract the edges, with their osm_id and relevant columns\nosm_network_edges &lt;- osm_network$osm_lines[, c(\"osm_id\", \"name\", \"highway\", \"maxspeed\",\n    \"oneway\")]\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_network_nodes)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -0.1541499 ymin: 51.52434 xmax: -0.1457924 ymax: 51.52698\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n      osm_id                    geometry\n78112  78112 POINT (-0.1457924 51.52698)\n99878  99878 POINT (-0.1529787 51.52434)\n99879  99879 POINT (-0.1532941 51.52484)\n99880  99880 POINT (-0.1535802 51.52508)\n99882  99882 POINT (-0.1541499 51.52567)\n99883  99883 POINT (-0.1541362 51.52598)\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_network_edges)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -0.1398347 ymin: 51.50608 xmax: -0.0821093 ymax: 51.5246\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n         osm_id                 name     highway maxspeed oneway\n31030     31030          Grafton Way     primary   20 mph    yes\n31039     31039 Tottenham Court Road     primary   20 mph   &lt;NA&gt;\n31959     31959     Cleveland Street residential   20 mph    yes\n554369   554369  King William Street    tertiary   20 mph    yes\n554526   554526     Fenchurch Street    tertiary   20 mph   &lt;NA&gt;\n1530592 1530592  Borough High Street     primary   30 mph    yes\n                              geometry\n31030   LINESTRING (-0.1349283 51.5...\n31039   LINESTRING (-0.1303693 51.5...\n31959   LINESTRING (-0.139512 51.52...\n554369  LINESTRING (-0.0877134 51.5...\n554526  LINESTRING (-0.085135 51.51...\n1530592 LINESTRING (-0.0882957 51.5...\n\n\nWe can quickly map the network edges to see how the road network looks like:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(osm_network_edges) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_lines(\n    col = \"#bdbdbd\",\n    lwd = 0.2,\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(lambeth) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_borders(\n    col = \"#252525\",\n    lwd = 2\n  ) +\n\n  # legend\n  tm_add_legend(\n    type = \"lines\",\n    labels = \"Road segments\",\n    col = \"#bdbdbd\",\n    frame = FALSE\n  ) +\n\n  tm_add_legend(\n    type = \"lines\",\n    labels = \"Outline Lambeth\",\n    col = \"#252525\",\n    frame = FALSE\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(1.0, 0.15),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Extracted OpenStreetMap road network data for Lambeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our focus is on schoolchildren and walking distances, we will overwrite the oneway variable to assume that none of the road segments are restricted to one-way traffic. This adjustment will ensure our analysis is not skewed by such restrictions and will help maintain a more accurate representation of the general connectivity of the network.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# overwrite one-way default\nosm_network_edges$oneway &lt;- \"no\"\n\n\nNow we have the network edges, we can turn this into a graph-representation that allows for the calculation of network-based accessibility statistics with our prepared point of interest data.\nIn any network analysis, the primary data structure is a graph composed of nodes and edges. The dodgr library utilises weighting profiles to assign weights based on road types, tailored to the mode of transport that each profile is designed to model. In this instance, we will use the foot weighting profile, as our focus is on modelling walking accessibility. To prevent errors related to the weighting profile, we will replace any NA values in the highway tag with the value unclassified.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# replace missing highway tags with unclassified\nosm_network_edges &lt;- osm_network_edges |&gt;\n    mutate(highway = if_else(is.na(highway), \"unclassified\", highway))\n\n# create network graph\nosm_network_graph &lt;- weight_streetnet(osm_network_edges, wt_profile = \"foot\")\n\n\nOnce we have constructed our graph, we can use it to calculate network distances between our points of interest. One important consideration is that not all individual components in the extracted network may be connected. This can occur, for example, if the bounding box cuts off access to the road of a cul-de-sac. To ensure that our entire extracted network is connected, we will therefore extract the largest connected component of the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dodgr package documentation explains that components are numbered in order of decreasing size, with $component = 1 always representing the largest component. It is essential to inspect the resulting subgraph to ensure that its coverage is adequate for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract the largest connected graph component\nnetx_connected &lt;- osm_network_graph[osm_network_graph$component == 1, ]\n\n# inspect number of remaining road segments\nnrow(netx_connected)\n\n\n[1] 517026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMap is a dynamic dataset, meaning that changes are made on a continuous basis. As a result, it is quite possible that the number of remaining road segments, as shown above, may differ slightly when you run this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have our connected subgraph, we can use the dodgr_distances() function to calculate the network distances between every possible origin (i.e. school) and destination (i.e. fast food outlet). For all combinations, the function will map the point of interest locations to the nearest point on the network and return the corresponding shortest-path distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dodgr package requires data to be projected in WGS84, so we need to reproject our point of interest data accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# reproject\npoi_schools &lt;- poi_schools |&gt;\n    st_transform(4326)\npoi_fastfood &lt;- poi_fastfood |&gt;\n    st_transform(4326)\n\n# distance matrix\ndistance_matrix &lt;- dodgr_distances(netx_connected, from = st_coordinates(poi_schools),\n    to = st_coordinates(poi_fastfood), shortest = FALSE, pairwise = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)\n\n\nThe result of this computation is a distance matrix that contains the network distances between all origins (i.e. schools) and all destinations (i.e. fast-food outlets):\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\ndistance_matrix[1:5, 1:5]\n\n\n            6807494201 7110321980 7110321980 12488816452 12376580459\n8796433764    4645.701   4645.734   4645.734    3108.422    3085.491\n8820889464    3645.986   3787.217   3787.217    1986.504    1963.574\n11479633279   8468.380   8468.413   8468.413    6905.914    6882.983\n292521291     5209.154   5209.186   5209.186    3801.380    3849.844\n12331531180   5882.399   5882.432   5882.432    5284.797    5333.262\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above output displays the distance (in metres) between the first five schools and the first five fast-food outlets. The row and column IDs refer to the nearest nodes on the OSM network to which the schools and fast-food outlets were mapped.\n\n\n\nNow that we have the distance matrix, we can aggregate the data and perform accessibility analysis. For example, we can count the number of fast-food outlets within 500 or 1,000 metres walking distance from each school:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# fast-food outlets within 500m\npoi_schools$fastfood_500m &lt;- rowSums(distance_matrix &lt;= 500)\n\n# fast-food outlets within 1000m\npoi_schools$fastfood_1000m &lt;- rowSums(distance_matrix &lt;= 1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can further inspect the results using the View() function.\n\n\n\nIn the final step, we can investigate whether there is a relationship between the proximity of fast-food outlets and the relative levels of deprivation in the area. One approach is to calculate the average number of fast-food outlets within 1,000 metres of a school for each LSOA, and then compare these figures to their corresponding IMD deciles.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read imd dataset\nimd19 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/England-IMD-2019.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 32844 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): lsoa11cd\ndbl (2): imd_rank, imd_dec\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# join imd\nlsoa11 &lt;- lsoa11 |&gt;\n  left_join(imd19, by = c(\"lsoa11cd\" = \"lsoa11cd\"))\n\n# join schools to their parent lsoa\npoi_schools &lt;- poi_schools |&gt;\n  st_transform(27700) |&gt;\n  st_join(lsoa11)\n\nWe can use this approach to derive the average number of fast-food by IMD decile:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# average counts by imd decile\nfastfood_imd &lt;- poi_schools |&gt;\n    group_by(imd_dec) |&gt;\n    mutate(avg_cnt = mean(fastfood_1000m)) |&gt;\n    distinct(imd_dec, avg_cnt) |&gt;\n    arrange(imd_dec)\n\n# inspect\nfastfood_imd\n\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n# Groups:   imd_dec [7]\n  imd_dec avg_cnt\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       2    20.4\n2       3    15.3\n3       4    20.5\n4       5    12.3\n5       6     3  \n6       7     9.4\n7       8    23.5\n\n\nThere appears to be a weak relationship, with schools in more deprived areas having, on average, a higher number of fast-food outlets within a 1,000-metre walking distance. However, this trend is not consistent, as schools in the least deprived areas of Lambeth show the highest accessibility on average.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility analysis involves evaluating how easily people can reach essential services, destinations, or opportunities, such as schools, healthcare facilities, or workplaces, from a given location. The CDRC Access to Healthy Assets & Hazards (AHAH) dataset, for instance, uses accessibility analysis to quantify how easy it is to reach ‘unhealthy’ places, such as pubs and gambling outlets, for each neighbourhood in Great Britain.\nHaving run through all the steps during the tutorial, we can recreate this analysis ourselves. Using Lambeth as a case study, try to complete the following tasks:\n\nExtract all pubs from the Point of Interest dataset.\nFor each LSOA within Lambeth, calculate the average walking distance to the nearest pub.\nCreate a map of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike before, LSOAs are now the unit of analysis. This means you will need to input the LSOA centroids into your distance matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to take a deep dive into accessibility analysis, there is a great resource that got published recently: Introduction to urban accessibility: a practical guide in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis brings us to the end of the tutorial. You should now have a basic understanding of the concepts behind accessibility analysis, how it can be executed in R, and some of the challenges you may encounter when conducting your own research. With this being said, you have now reached the end of this week’s content. Onwards and upwards!"

    "text": "This week, we will analyse the accessibility of fast-food outlets in the London Borough of Lambeth. Specifically, we will examine how closely these outlets are located within walking distance of primary and secondary schools, and explore any potential relationships between their proximity and the relative levels of deprivation in the area.\nWe will extract the points of interest that we will use for this analysis from the Point of Interest (POI) data for the United Kingdom, obtained from the Overture Maps Foundation and pre-processed by the Consumer Data Research Centre to provide users with easy access.\nYou can download a subset of the POI dataset via the link provided below.

We will use OpenStreetMap to extract road segment data. Similar to the POI dataset, OSM uses key and value tags to categorise the features within its dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map of the world, but its coverage is uneven globally. However, the accuracy and quality of the data can at times be questionable, with details such as road types and speed limits missing. The OpenStreetMap Wiki provides more details on the tagging system.\n\n\n\nTo download the Lambeth road network dataset, we first need to define our bounding box coordinates. We will then use these coordinates in our OSM query to extract specific types of road segments within the defined search area. Our focus will be on selecting all OSM features with the highway tag that are likely to be used by pedestrians (e.g. excluding motorways).\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define our bbox coordinates, use WGS84\nbbox_lambeth &lt;- poi24 |&gt;\n    st_transform(4326) |&gt;\n    st_bbox()\n\n# osm query\nosm_network &lt;- opq(bbox = bbox_lambeth) |&gt;\n    add_osm_feature(key = \"highway\", value = c(\"primary\", \"secondary\", \"tertiary\",\n        \"residential\", \"path\", \"footway\", \"unclassified\", \"living_street\", \"pedestrian\")) |&gt;\n    osmdata_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the OSM query may return an error, particularly when multiple users from the same location are executing the exact same query. If so, you can download a prepared copy of the data here: [Download]. You can load this copy into R through load('data/spatial/London-OSM-Roads.RData')\n\n\n\nThe returned osm_network object contains a variety of elements with the specified tags. Our next step is to extract the spatial data from this object to create our road network dataset. Specifically, we will extract the edges of the network, which represent the lines of the roads, as well as the nodes, which represent the points where the roads start, end, or intersect.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract the nodes, with their osm_id\nosm_network_nodes &lt;- osm_network$osm_points[, \"osm_id\"]\n\n# extract the edges, with their osm_id and relevant columns\nosm_network_edges &lt;- osm_network$osm_lines[, c(\"osm_id\", \"name\", \"highway\", \"maxspeed\",\n    \"oneway\")]\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_network_nodes)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -0.1541499 ymin: 51.52434 xmax: -0.1457924 ymax: 51.52698\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n      osm_id                    geometry\n78112  78112 POINT (-0.1457924 51.52698)\n99878  99878 POINT (-0.1529787 51.52434)\n99879  99879 POINT (-0.1532941 51.52484)\n99880  99880 POINT (-0.1535802 51.52508)\n99882  99882 POINT (-0.1541499 51.52567)\n99883  99883 POINT (-0.1541362 51.52598)\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_network_edges)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -0.1398347 ymin: 51.50608 xmax: -0.0821093 ymax: 51.5246\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n         osm_id                 name     highway maxspeed oneway\n31030     31030          Grafton Way     primary   20 mph    yes\n31039     31039 Tottenham Court Road     primary   20 mph   &lt;NA&gt;\n31959     31959     Cleveland Street residential   20 mph    yes\n554369   554369  King William Street    tertiary   20 mph    yes\n554526   554526     Fenchurch Street    tertiary   20 mph   &lt;NA&gt;\n1530592 1530592  Borough High Street     primary   30 mph    yes\n                              geometry\n31030   LINESTRING (-0.1349283 51.5...\n31039   LINESTRING (-0.1303693 51.5...\n31959   LINESTRING (-0.139512 51.52...\n554369  LINESTRING (-0.0877134 51.5...\n554526  LINESTRING (-0.085135 51.51...\n1530592 LINESTRING (-0.0882957 51.5...\n\n\nWe can quickly map the network edges to see how the road network looks like:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(osm_network_edges) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_lines(\n    col = \"#bdbdbd\",\n    lwd = 0.2,\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(lambeth) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_borders(\n    col = \"#252525\",\n    lwd = 2\n  ) +\n\n  # legend\n  tm_add_legend(\n    type = \"lines\",\n    labels = \"Road segments\",\n    col = \"#bdbdbd\",\n    frame = FALSE\n  ) +\n\n  tm_add_legend(\n    type = \"lines\",\n    labels = \"Outline Lambeth\",\n    col = \"#252525\",\n    frame = FALSE\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(1.0, 0.15),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Extracted OpenStreetMap road network data for Lambeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our focus is on schoolchildren and walking distances, we will overwrite the oneway variable to assume that none of the road segments are restricted to one-way traffic. This adjustment will ensure our analysis is not skewed by such restrictions and will help maintain a more accurate representation of the general connectivity of the network.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# overwrite one-way default\nosm_network_edges$oneway &lt;- \"no\"\n\n\nNow we have the network edges, we can turn this into a graph-representation that allows for the calculation of network-based accessibility statistics with our prepared point of interest data.\nIn any network analysis, the primary data structure is a graph composed of nodes and edges. The dodgr library utilises weighting profiles to assign weights based on road types, tailored to the mode of transport that each profile is designed to model. In this instance, we will use the foot weighting profile, as our focus is on modelling walking accessibility. To prevent errors related to the weighting profile, we will replace any NA values in the highway tag with the value unclassified.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# replace missing highway tags with unclassified\nosm_network_edges &lt;- osm_network_edges |&gt;\n    mutate(highway = if_else(is.na(highway), \"unclassified\", highway))\n\n# create network graph\nosm_network_graph &lt;- weight_streetnet(osm_network_edges, wt_profile = \"foot\")\n\n\nOnce we have constructed our graph, we can use it to calculate network distances between our points of interest. One important consideration is that not all individual components in the extracted network may be connected. This can occur, for example, if the bounding box cuts off access to the road of a cul-de-sac. To ensure that our entire extracted network is connected, we will therefore extract the largest connected component of the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dodgr package documentation explains that components are numbered in order of decreasing size, with $component = 1 always representing the largest component. It is essential to inspect the resulting subgraph to ensure that its coverage is adequate for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract the largest connected graph component\nnetx_connected &lt;- osm_network_graph[osm_network_graph$component == 1, ]\n\n# inspect number of remaining road segments\nnrow(netx_connected)\n\n\n[1] 517026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMap is a dynamic dataset, meaning that changes are made on a continuous basis. As a result, it is quite possible that the number of remaining road segments, as shown above, may differ slightly when you run this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have our connected subgraph, we can use the dodgr_distances() function to calculate the network distances between every possible origin (i.e. school) and destination (i.e. fast food outlet). For all combinations, the function will map the point of interest locations to the nearest point on the network and return the corresponding shortest-path distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dodgr package requires data to be projected in WGS84, so we need to reproject our point of interest data accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# reproject\npoi_schools &lt;- poi_schools |&gt;\n    st_transform(4326)\npoi_fastfood &lt;- poi_fastfood |&gt;\n    st_transform(4326)\n\n# distance matrix\ndistance_matrix &lt;- dodgr_distances(netx_connected, from = st_coordinates(poi_schools),\n    to = st_coordinates(poi_fastfood), shortest = FALSE, pairwise = FALSE, quiet = FALSE)\n\n\nThe result of this computation is a distance matrix that contains the network distances between all origins (i.e. schools) and all destinations (i.e. fast-food outlets):\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# inspect\ndistance_matrix[1:5, 1:5]\n\n\n            6807494201 7110321980 7110321980 12488816452 12376580459\n8796433764    4645.701   4645.734   4645.734    3108.422    3085.491\n8820889464    3645.986   3787.217   3787.217    1986.504    1963.574\n11479633279   8468.380   8468.413   8468.413    6905.914    6882.983\n292521291     5209.154   5209.186   5209.186    3801.380    3849.844\n12331531180   5882.399   5882.432   5882.432    5284.797    5333.262\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above output displays the distance (in metres) between the first five schools and the first five fast-food outlets. The row and column IDs refer to the nearest nodes on the OSM network to which the schools and fast-food outlets were mapped.\n\n\n\nNow that we have the distance matrix, we can aggregate the data and perform accessibility analysis. For example, we can count the number of fast-food outlets within 500 or 1,000 metres walking distance from each school:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# fast-food outlets within 500m\npoi_schools$fastfood_500m &lt;- rowSums(distance_matrix &lt;= 500)\n\n# fast-food outlets within 1000m\npoi_schools$fastfood_1000m &lt;- rowSums(distance_matrix &lt;= 1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can further inspect the results using the View() function.\n\n\n\nIn the final step, we can investigate whether there is a relationship between the proximity of fast-food outlets and the relative levels of deprivation in the area. One approach is to calculate the average number of fast-food outlets within 1,000 metres of a school for each LSOA, and then compare these figures to their corresponding IMD deciles.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read imd dataset\nimd19 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/attributes/England-IMD-2019.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 32844 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): lsoa11cd\ndbl (2): imd_rank, imd_dec\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n# join imd\nlsoa11 &lt;- lsoa11 |&gt;\n  left_join(imd19, by = c(\"lsoa11cd\" = \"lsoa11cd\"))\n\n# join schools to their parent lsoa\npoi_schools &lt;- poi_schools |&gt;\n  st_transform(27700) |&gt;\n  st_join(lsoa11)\n\nWe can use this approach to derive the average number of fast-food by IMD decile:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# average counts by imd decile\nfastfood_imd &lt;- poi_schools |&gt;\n    group_by(imd_dec) |&gt;\n    mutate(avg_cnt = mean(fastfood_1000m)) |&gt;\n    distinct(imd_dec, avg_cnt) |&gt;\n    arrange(imd_dec)\n\n# inspect\nfastfood_imd\n\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n# Groups:   imd_dec [7]\n  imd_dec avg_cnt\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1       2    20.4\n2       3    15.3\n3       4    20.5\n4       5    12.3\n5       6     3  \n6       7     9.4\n7       8    23.5\n\n\nThere appears to be a weak relationship, with schools in more deprived areas having, on average, a higher number of fast-food outlets within a 1,000-metre walking distance. However, this trend is not consistent, as schools in the least deprived areas of Lambeth show the highest accessibility on average."

To explore this, we examined the relationship between the proportion of individuals over 50 years old in each parliamentary constituency (aged_50_years_and_over) and the proportion of votes cast for the Conservative Party (conservative_vote_share). A scatterplot and Pearson’s correlation revealed a moderate association between the two variables, suggesting a possible link between age demographics and Conservative voting patterns:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# correlation\ncor.test(elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over, elec_24$conservative_vote_share, method = \"pearson\")\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over and elec_24$conservative_vote_share\nt = 16.472, df = 573, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.5086971 0.6199173\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.5668849 \n\n# scatterplot\nplot(elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over, elec_24$conservative_vote_share, xlab = \"Proportion of population over 50 years old\",\n    ylab = \"Proportion of votes for the Conservative party\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Quick scatterplot\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as you should know by now, the first step when working with spatial data is to map your variables:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join attribute data onto spatial data\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n  left_join(elec_24, by = c(\"pcon24cd\" = \"constituency_code\"))\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"conservative_vote_share\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#f1eef6\", \"#bdc9e1\", \"#74a9cf\", \"#2b8cbe\", \"#045a8d\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Conservative vote share\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportions of votes cast for the Conservative party in the 2024 elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"aged_50_years_and_over\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#f0f0f0\", \"#d9d9d9\", \"#bdbdbd\", \"#969696\", \"#737373\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"50+ population share\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Proportions of population over 50 years old.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the maps, the spatial distribution of Conservative vote share and the proportion of the population over 50 appears neither random nor uniform. This raises the question to what extent the observed correlation in Figure 1 holds consistently across different constituencies? To answer this we can run a Geographically Weighted Correlation using the GWmodel library.\nGeographically Weighted Correlation (GWC) allows us to investigate whether the strength and direction of the association between variables vary across space. By applying a localised correlation technique, GWC calculates the correlation coefficient within specified spatial windows or kernels across the study area. This can reveal geographic areas where the relationship is stronger or weaker, providing more insight than a single global correlation and helping us to understand spatial heterogeneity in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GWmodel library allows us to calculate local statistics, such as means, standard deviations, variances, and correlations. But as with spatial autocorrelation, we must define what local means. One approach is to use a kernel function to select which values contribute to each local estimate. Kernels operate on point locations (e.g. polygon centroids) and apply a window with a specified shape and bandwidth. The bandwidth, which defines the kernel’s size, can be set in absolute terms (e.g. within 10 km) or in relative terms (e.g. the 10 nearest centroids), the latter known as an adaptive kernel.\n\n\n\nThe GWmodel library uses the older sp data format for handling spatial data. We therefore need to convert our current sf object to sp before continuing:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to sp\ncons_24_sp &lt;- as_Spatial(cons_24)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sf package is now preferred over sp in R for its modern, efficient handling of spatial data. By using simple features, a standardised format for spatial geometries, sf is more compatible with other geospatial tools and integrates smoothly with the tidyverse, simplifying data manipulation and analysis. However, some libraries still rely on sp and have not yet transitioned to sf.\n\n\n\nWe can now calculate a geographically weighted correlation. We will use an adaptive bandwidth that estimates the local correlation using the 25 nearest constituencies:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# geographically weighted correlation\ncons_24_cor &lt;- gwss(cons_24_sp, vars = c(\"conservative_vote_share\", \"aged_50_years_and_over\"),\n    bw = 25, adaptive = TRUE)\n\n\nWe can now extract the values and bind these back to our original sf object:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract correlation\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n    mutate(cons_age_cor = cons_24_cor$SDF$Corr_conservative_vote_share.aged_50_years_and_over)\n\n# inspect\nsummary(cons_24$cons_age_cor)\n\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

Max. \n-0.02121  0.57869  0.72341  0.68576  0.83984  0.95214 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the outcomes of gwss function can be accessed through the $SDF data frame.\n\n\n\nThe summary shows that there indeed seems to be variation of this relationship across the country, with the local Pearson correlation ranging from very weak to very strong. Of course, we can map this in the usual way:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"cons_age_cor\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#fee5d9\", \"#fcae91\", \"#fb6a4a\", \"#de2d26\", \"#a50f15\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Local correlation\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Local correlation values conservative_vote_share and aged_50_years_and_over variables.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the map shows correlation patterns, it does not indicate statistical significance. To evaluate this, we can use a Monte Carlo simulation with the gwss.montecarlo() function. However, for a large dataset like ours, this process is computationally intensive and time-consuming, especially with more than the default 99 simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we will not run a Monte Carlo simulation here, the code below demonstrates how to run this and link the results back to the cons_24 spatial dataframe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# geographically weighted correlation, monte carlo simulation\ncons_24_cor_sig &lt;- gwss.montecarlo(cons_24_sp, vars = c(\"conservative_vote_share\",\n    \"aged_50_years_and_over\"), bw = 25, adaptive = TRUE, nsim = 99) |&gt;\n    as_tibble() |&gt;\n    select(Corr_conservative_vote_share.aged_50_years_and_over)\n\n# replace names\nnames(cons_24_cor_sig) &lt;- \"cons_age_cor_p\"\n\n# bind results\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n    cbind(cons_24_cor_sig) |&gt;\n    mutate(cons_24_cor = if_else(cons_age_cor_p &lt; 0.025, cons_age_cor_p, if_else(cons_age_cor_p &gt;\n        0.975, cons_age_cor_p, NA)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took more than 2 minutes to run the Monte Carlo simulation on an Apple MacBook Pro M1 (16GB RAM) with the default of 99 simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA correlation describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship, but if we want to quantify the change in a dependent variable (y) for a one-unit change in the independent variable(s) (x) we need to run a regression. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is used when the relationship between a dependent and set of independent variables is not constant across space, meaning the model coefficients vary by location. This is useful when you suspect that the relationship between variables may change depending on the geographic context. GWR provides a localised understanding of the relationships by allowing each observation to have its own set of regression coefficients, which can provide insights into how relationships differ across the study area.\nGWR fits a separate regression equation at each location in the study area, weighting nearby observations more heavily than those farther away. Again, the weighting is typically based on a kernel function. The basic GWR equation is:\n\\[\ny_{i} = \\beta_{0}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i}) + \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\beta_{k}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})x_{ik} + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\]\nwhere \\((\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})\\) are the coordinates of location \\(i\\) and \\(\\beta_{k}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})\\) are the location-specific coefficients.\n\n\nTo predict the Conservative voter share, we hypothesise that certain socio-demographic variables may play a significant role. These independent variables include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neco_active_employed\nProportion of economically active employed individuals.\n\n\neco_active_unemployed\nProportion of economically active unemployed individuals.\n\n\neth_white\nProportion of the population identifying as white.\n\n\neth_black\nProportion of the population identifying as black.\n\n\naged_25_to_34_years\nProportion of the population between ages 25 and 34.\n\n\naged_50_years_and_over\nProportion of the population over age 50.\n\n\n\nWe can run the multivariate regression as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# regression\nlm_voteshare &lt;- lm(conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + eco_active_unemployed +\n    eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24)\n\n# summary\nsummary(lm_voteshare)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + \n    eco_active_unemployed + eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + \n    aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24)\n\nResiduals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.286730 -0.040843  0.001182  0.044496  0.220419 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.

The results suggest that older and employed populations are linked to higher Conservative support, while younger age groups and certain ethnic proportions show a negative relationship.\nWe can now run the diagnostics to see whether the regression assumptions are met:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run diagnostics\nperformance::check_model(lm_voteshare, check = c(\"qq\", \"normality\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Check for normality of residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run diagnostics\nperformance::check_model(lm_voteshare, check = c(\"linearity\", \"homogeneity\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Check for linearity and homogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run diagnostics\nperformance::check_model(lm_voteshare, check = c(\"vif\", \"outliers\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Check for influential observations and multicollinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model diagnostics seem generally fine, perhaps except for the linearity check. This could indicate a curved relationship or, alternatively, suggest spatial dependence in the relationship. If spatial dependence is present, it may imply that the observations are not independent. We can examine this by assessing whether the model residuals display spatial dependence. Let us begin with a map:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join model residuals onto spatial data\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n  mutate(lm_residuals = lm_voteshare$residuals)\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"lm_residuals\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#ffffb2\", \"#fecc5c\", \"#fd8d3c\", \"#f03b20\", \"#f03b20\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Regression residuals\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Regression model residuals.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at Figure 8 there appears to be some spatial structure in the model residuals.

As a result, we can proceed with a Geographically Weighted Regression to account for spatial variation in the relationship between the variables.\nWe will first estimate the ‘optimal’ bandwidth using an automated bandwidth selection procedure:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# bandwidth selection\ncons_24_bw &lt;- bw.gwr(conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + eco_active_unemployed +\n    eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24,\n    adaptive = TRUE)\n\n\nAdaptive bandwidth: 363 CV score: 2.208986 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 232 CV score: 2.105893 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 151 CV score: 1.973309 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 100 CV score: 1.940199 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 70 CV score: 2.008461 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 120 CV score: 1.945603 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 89 CV score: 1.942555 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 108 CV score: 1.938444 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 112 CV score: 1.942082 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 104 CV score: 1.938601 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 109 CV score: 1.940144 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 106 CV score: 1.939139 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 108 CV score: 1.938444 \n\n\nThe model can then be fitted.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run gwr\ncons_24_gwr &lt;- gwr.basic(conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + eco_active_unemployed +\n    eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24,\n    adaptive = TRUE, bw = cons_24_bw)\n\n# inspect\ncons_24_gwr\n\n\n   ***********************************************************************\n   *                       Package   GWmodel                             *\n   ***********************************************************************\n   Program starts at: 2025-12-17 14:47:54.379477 \n   Call:\n   gwr.basic(formula = conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + \n    eco_active_unemployed + eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + \n    aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24, bw = cons_24_bw, \n    adaptive = TRUE)\n\n   Dependent (y) variable:  conservative_vote_share\n   Independent variables:  eco_active_employed eco_active_unemployed eth_white eth_black aged_25_to_34_years aged_50_years_and_over\n   Number of data points: 575\n   ***********************************************************************\n   *                    Results of Global Regression                     *\n   ***********************************************************************\n\n   Call:\n    lm(formula = formula, data = data)\n\n   Residuals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.286730 -0.040843  0.001182  0.044496  0.220419 \n\n   Coefficients:\n                          Estimate Std.

In contrast, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) results stem from 575 separate but spatially overlapping regression models, each fitted with geographic weighting to different spatial subsets of the data, allowing for local variation in the regression estimates. We can also see that the model fit (adjusted \\(R^2\\)) has increased to 70%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the local estimates are contained in the spatial data frame cons_24_gwr$SDF. You can inspect the results using the View() function.\n\n\n\nWe can now also map all the local \\(R^2\\) values to get an idea of how well the model fit varies spatially:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join local r squared values onto spatial data\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n  mutate(gwr_r2 = cons_24_gwr$SDF$Local_R2)\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"gwr_r2\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#fee5d9\", \"#fcae91\", \"#fb6a4a\", \"#de2d26\", \"#a50f15\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Local R-squared\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Model performance of the Geographically Weighted Regression.\n\n\n\n\nIn similar fashion, and with some data wrangling, we can map the individual local coefficients of our independent variables:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join local coefficient values onto spatial data, select, pivot\ncons_24_coef &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    eco_active_employed_coef = cons_24_gwr$SDF$eco_active_employed,\n    eco_active_unemployed_coef = cons_24_gwr$SDF$eco_active_unemployed,\n    eth_white_coef = cons_24_gwr$SDF$eth_white,\n    eth_black_coef = cons_24_gwr$SDF$eth_black,\n    aged_25_to_34_years_coef = cons_24_gwr$SDF$aged_25_to_34_years,\n    aged_50_years_and_over_coef = cons_24_gwr$SDF$aged_50_years_and_over\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(40:45) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = !geom, names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"coefficient\")\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24_coef) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"coefficient\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 9, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\n        \"#7f3b08\", \"#b35806\", \"#e08214\", \"#fdb863\", \"#f7f7f7\",\n        \"#d8daeb\", \"#b2abd2\", \"#8073ac\", \"#542788\"\n      ),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Local GWR coefficient\",\n      frame = FALSE\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # facet\n  tm_facets(\n    by = \"variable\",\n    ncol = 3,\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = TRUE,\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE,\n    panel.labels = c(\n      \"Age: 25-34\", \"Age: &gt;50\", \"Employed\", \"Unemployed\",\n      \"Ethnicity: Black\", \"Ethnicity: White\"\n    ),\n  )\n\n\nUse \"fisher\" instead of \"jenks\" for larger data sets\n\n\n[scale] tm_polygons:() the data variable assigned to 'fill' contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0.

We can use use the estimated \\(t\\)-values, as indicated by the _TV suffix in the SDF data frame of the GWR results, to filter out those are not. For example, to filter at 95% confidence, remove \\(t\\)-values outside the range of -1.96 to +1.96.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive dive into Geographically Weighted Regression, the Spatial Modelling for Data Scientists course by Liverpool-based Professors Francisco Rowe and Dani Arribas-Bel provides an excellent introduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we have looked at geographically weighted correlation and regression. However, whilst out of the scope of this module, there are many other approaches to account for space in statistical models. Examples of such models are the spatial error model and the spatial lag model.\n\n\nThe spatial error model is used when the error terms in a regression model exhibit spatial autocorrelation, meaning the error terms are not independent across space. This can happen due to omitted variables that have a spatial pattern or unmeasured factors that affect the dependent variable similarly across nearby locations.\nThe model adjusts for spatial autocorrelation by adding a spatially lagged error term (a weighted sum of the errors from neighbouring locations) to the regression equation:\n\\[\ny = X\\beta + \\upsilon, \\upsilon = \\lambda W \\upsilon + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\beta\\) represents the standard regression components, \\(\\lambda\\) is a spatial autoregressive parameter, \\(W\\) is a spatial weights matrix, and \\(\\upsilon\\) is a vector of spatially autocorrelated errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial error models can be fitted using R’s spatialreg package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial lag model is appropriate when the dependent variable itself exhibits spatial dependence. This means the value of the dependent variable in one location depends on the values in neighbouring locations. This model is used to capture the spillover effects or diffusion processes, where the outcome in one area is influenced by outcomes in nearby areas (e.g. house prices, crime rates).\nThe model incorporates a spatially lagged dependent variable, which is the weighted sum of the dependent variable values in neighbouring locations, into the regression equation:\n\\[\ny = \\rho Wy + X\\beta + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the spatial autoregressive coefficient, \\(Wy\\) represents the spatially lagged dependent variable, and \\(X\\beta\\) represents the standard regression components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial lag models can be fitted using R’s spatialreg package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial error model adjusts for spatial autocorrelation in the error terms, whereas the spatial lag model adjusts for spatial dependence in the dependent variable itself. The spatial error model does not alter the interpretation of the coefficients of the independent variables, while the spatial lag model introduces a feedback loop where changes in one area can influence neighbouring areas.\nBoth the spatial error and spatial lag models assume that the relationships between variables are the same across the study area, with adjustments made only for spatial dependencies. GWR, on the other hand, allows the relationships themselves to vary across space. GWR is more flexible but also more complex and computationally intensive, providing local instead of global estimates of coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) reveals some varying patterns in the sign and directiion of the Conservative voter share, but it is likely that other factors are at play. One could hypothesise that another potential predictor of the Conservative vote share is the proportion of the population employed in a particular industry. Try to do the following:\n\nDownload the dataset provided below and save it to the appropriate subfolder within your data directory. The csv, extracted using the Custom Dataset Tool, contains the number of employed individuals as recorded in the 2021 Census by their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.\nFormulate a hypothesis regarding which of the nine main industries presented in the dataset might help predict the Conservative vote share.\nFor the chosen industry variable:\n\nCalculate the share of individuals employed in that industry.\nExtend the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) by including this new variable.\n\nWhat do the results suggest? Is this variable associated with any changes in Conservative vote share?\nCreate a map of the local coefficients for this variable.\n\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nEngland and Wales Parliamentary Constituencies Employed by Industry\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, we explored decomposing global measures to account for non-stationarity in spatial variables. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is particularly useful when the relationship between variables varies across space, as it allows for localised regression coefficients and helps identify spatial heterogeneity that might be overlooked in global models. This was a rather heavy one, time for some light reading?"

To explore this, we examined the relationship between the proportion of individuals over 50 years old in each parliamentary constituency (aged_50_years_and_over) and the proportion of votes cast for the Conservative Party (conservative_vote_share). A scatterplot and Pearson’s correlation revealed a moderate association between the two variables, suggesting a possible link between age demographics and Conservative voting patterns:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# correlation\ncor.test(elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over, elec_24$conservative_vote_share, method = \"pearson\")\n\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over and elec_24$conservative_vote_share\nt = 16.472, df = 573, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.5086971 0.6199173\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.5668849 \n\n# scatterplot\nplot(elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over, elec_24$conservative_vote_share, xlab = \"Proportion of population over 50 years old\",\n    ylab = \"Proportion of votes for the Conservative party\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Quick scatterplot\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as you should know by now, the first step when working with spatial data is to map your variables:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join attribute data onto spatial data\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n  left_join(elec_24, by = c(\"pcon24cd\" = \"constituency_code\"))\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"conservative_vote_share\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#f1eef6\", \"#bdc9e1\", \"#74a9cf\", \"#2b8cbe\", \"#045a8d\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Conservative vote share\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportions of votes cast for the Conservative party in the 2024 elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"aged_50_years_and_over\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#f0f0f0\", \"#d9d9d9\", \"#bdbdbd\", \"#969696\", \"#737373\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"50+ population share\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Proportions of population over 50 years old.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the maps, the spatial distribution of Conservative vote share and the proportion of the population over 50 appears neither random nor uniform. This raises the question to what extent the observed correlation in Figure 1 holds consistently across different constituencies? To answer this we can run a Geographically Weighted Correlation using the GWmodel library.\nGeographically Weighted Correlation (GWC) allows us to investigate whether the strength and direction of the association between variables vary across space. By applying a localised correlation technique, GWC calculates the correlation coefficient within specified spatial windows or kernels across the study area. This can reveal geographic areas where the relationship is stronger or weaker, providing more insight than a single global correlation and helping us to understand spatial heterogeneity in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GWmodel library allows us to calculate local statistics, such as means, standard deviations, variances, and correlations. But as with spatial autocorrelation, we must define what local means. One approach is to use a kernel function to select which values contribute to each local estimate. Kernels operate on point locations (e.g. polygon centroids) and apply a window with a specified shape and bandwidth. The bandwidth, which defines the kernel’s size, can be set in absolute terms (e.g. within 10 km) or in relative terms (e.g. the 10 nearest centroids), the latter known as an adaptive kernel.\n\n\n\nThe GWmodel library uses the older sp data format for handling spatial data. We therefore need to convert our current sf object to sp before continuing:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to sp\ncons_24_sp &lt;- as_Spatial(cons_24)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sf package is now preferred over sp in R for its modern, efficient handling of spatial data. By using simple features, a standardised format for spatial geometries, sf is more compatible with other geospatial tools and integrates smoothly with the tidyverse, simplifying data manipulation and analysis. However, some libraries still rely on sp and have not yet transitioned to sf.\n\n\n\nWe can now calculate a geographically weighted correlation. We will use an adaptive bandwidth that estimates the local correlation using the 25 nearest constituencies:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# geographically weighted correlation\ncons_24_cor &lt;- gwss(cons_24_sp, vars = c(\"conservative_vote_share\", \"aged_50_years_and_over\"),\n    bw = 25, adaptive = TRUE)\n\n\nWe can now extract the values and bind these back to our original sf object:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract correlation\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n    mutate(cons_age_cor = cons_24_cor$SDF$Corr_conservative_vote_share.aged_50_years_and_over)\n\n# inspect\nsummary(cons_24$cons_age_cor)\n\n\n    Min.  1st Qu.

Max. \n-0.02121  0.57869  0.72341  0.68576  0.83984  0.95214 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the outcomes of gwss function can be accessed through the $SDF data frame.\n\n\n\nThe summary shows that there indeed seems to be variation of this relationship across the country, with the local Pearson correlation ranging from very weak to very strong. Of course, we can map this in the usual way:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"cons_age_cor\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#fee5d9\", \"#fcae91\", \"#fb6a4a\", \"#de2d26\", \"#a50f15\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Local correlation\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Local correlation values conservative_vote_share and aged_50_years_and_over variables.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the map shows correlation patterns, it does not indicate statistical significance. To evaluate this, we can use a Monte Carlo simulation with the gwss.montecarlo() function. However, for a large dataset like ours, this process is computationally intensive and time-consuming, especially with more than the default 99 simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we will not run a Monte Carlo simulation here, the code below demonstrates how to run this and link the results back to the cons_24 spatial dataframe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# geographically weighted correlation, monte carlo simulation\ncons_24_cor_sig &lt;- gwss.montecarlo(cons_24_sp, vars = c(\"conservative_vote_share\",\n    \"aged_50_years_and_over\"), bw = 25, adaptive = TRUE, nsim = 99) |&gt;\n    as_tibble() |&gt;\n    select(Corr_conservative_vote_share.aged_50_years_and_over)\n\n# replace names\nnames(cons_24_cor_sig) &lt;- \"cons_age_cor_p\"\n\n# bind results\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n    cbind(cons_24_cor_sig) |&gt;\n    mutate(cons_24_cor = if_else(cons_age_cor_p &lt; 0.025, cons_age_cor_p, if_else(cons_age_cor_p &gt;\n        0.975, cons_age_cor_p, NA)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took more than 2 minutes to run the Monte Carlo simulation on an Apple MacBook Pro M1 (16GB RAM) with the default of 99 simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA correlation describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship, but if we want to quantify the change in a dependent variable (y) for a one-unit change in the independent variable(s) (x) we need to run a regression. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is used when the relationship between a dependent and set of independent variables is not constant across space, meaning the model coefficients vary by location. This is useful when you suspect that the relationship between variables may change depending on the geographic context. GWR provides a localised understanding of the relationships by allowing each observation to have its own set of regression coefficients, which can provide insights into how relationships differ across the study area.\nGWR fits a separate regression equation at each location in the study area, weighting nearby observations more heavily than those farther away. Again, the weighting is typically based on a kernel function. The basic GWR equation is:\n\\[\ny_{i} = \\beta_{0}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i}) + \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\beta_{k}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})x_{ik} + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\]\nwhere \\((\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})\\) are the coordinates of location \\(i\\) and \\(\\beta_{k}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})\\) are the location-specific coefficients.\n\n\nTo predict the Conservative voter share, we hypothesise that certain socio-demographic variables may play a significant role. These independent variables include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neco_active_employed\nProportion of economically active employed individuals.\n\n\neco_active_unemployed\nProportion of economically active unemployed individuals.\n\n\neth_white\nProportion of the population identifying as white.\n\n\neth_black\nProportion of the population identifying as black.\n\n\naged_25_to_34_years\nProportion of the population between ages 25 and 34.\n\n\naged_50_years_and_over\nProportion of the population over age 50.\n\n\n\nWe can run the multivariate regression as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# regression\nlm_voteshare &lt;- lm(conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + eco_active_unemployed +\n    eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24)\n\n# summary\nsummary(lm_voteshare)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + \n    eco_active_unemployed + eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + \n    aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24)\n\nResiduals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.286730 -0.040843  0.001182  0.044496  0.220419 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.

The results suggest that older and employed populations are linked to higher Conservative support, while younger age groups and certain ethnic proportions show a negative relationship.\nWe can now run the diagnostics to see whether the regression assumptions are met:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run diagnostics\nperformance::check_model(lm_voteshare, check = c(\"qq\", \"normality\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Check for normality of residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run diagnostics\nperformance::check_model(lm_voteshare, check = c(\"linearity\", \"homogeneity\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Check for linearity and homogeneity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run diagnostics\nperformance::check_model(lm_voteshare, check = c(\"vif\", \"outliers\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Check for influential observations and multicollinearity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model diagnostics seem generally fine, perhaps except for the linearity check. This could indicate a curved relationship or, alternatively, suggest spatial dependence in the relationship. If spatial dependence is present, it may imply that the observations are not independent. We can examine this by assessing whether the model residuals display spatial dependence. Let us begin with a map:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# join model residuals onto spatial data\ncons_24 &lt;- cons_24 |&gt;\n  mutate(lm_residuals = lm_voteshare$residuals)\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"lm_residuals\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      n = 5, style = \"jenks\",\n      values = c(\"#ffffb2\", \"#fecc5c\", \"#fd8d3c\", \"#f03b20\", \"#f03b20\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Regression residuals\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(-0.2, 1.0),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Regression model residuals.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at Figure 8 there appears to be some spatial structure in the model residuals.

As a result, we can proceed with a Geographically Weighted Regression to account for spatial variation in the relationship between the variables.\nWe will first estimate the ‘optimal’ bandwidth using an automated bandwidth selection procedure:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# bandwidth selection\ncons_24_bw &lt;- bw.gwr(conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + eco_active_unemployed +\n    eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24,\n    adaptive = TRUE)\n\n\nAdaptive bandwidth: 363 CV score: 2.208986 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 232 CV score: 2.105893 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 151 CV score: 1.973309 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 100 CV score: 1.940199 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 70 CV score: 2.008461 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 120 CV score: 1.945603 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 89 CV score: 1.942555 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 108 CV score: 1.938444 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 112 CV score: 1.942082 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 104 CV score: 1.938601 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 109 CV score: 1.940144 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 106 CV score: 1.939139 \nAdaptive bandwidth: 108 CV score: 1.938444 \n\n\nThe model can then be fitted.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# run gwr\ncons_24_gwr &lt;- gwr.basic(conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + eco_active_unemployed +\n    eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24,\n    adaptive = TRUE, bw = cons_24_bw)\n\n# inspect\ncons_24_gwr\n\n\n   ***********************************************************************\n   *                       Package   GWmodel                             *\n   ***********************************************************************\n   Program starts at: 2025-12-17 14:47:54.379477 \n   Call:\n   gwr.basic(formula = conservative_vote_share ~ eco_active_employed + \n    eco_active_unemployed + eth_white + eth_black + aged_25_to_34_years + \n    aged_50_years_and_over, data = cons_24, bw = cons_24_bw, \n    adaptive = TRUE)\n\n   Dependent (y) variable:  conservative_vote_share\n   Independent variables:  eco_active_employed eco_active_unemployed eth_white eth_black aged_25_to_34_years aged_50_years_and_over\n   Number of data points: 575\n   ***********************************************************************\n   *                    Results of Global Regression                     *\n   ***********************************************************************\n\n   Call:\n    lm(formula = formula, data = data)\n\n   Residuals:\n      Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max \n-0.286730 -0.040843  0.001182  0.044496  0.220419 \n\n   Coefficients:\n                          Estimate Std.

In contrast, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) results stem from 575 separate but spatially overlapping regression models, each fitted with geographic weighting to different spatial subsets of the data, allowing for local variation in the regression estimates. We can also see that the model fit (adjusted \\(R^2\\)) has increased to 70%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the local estimates are contained in the spatial data frame cons_24_gwr$SDF.

We can use use the estimated \\(t\\)-values, as indicated by the _TV suffix in the SDF data frame of the GWR results, to filter out those are not. For example, to filter at 95% confidence, remove \\(t\\)-values outside the range of -1.96 to +1.96.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive dive into Geographically Weighted Regression, the Spatial Modelling for Data Scientists course by Liverpool-based Professors Francisco Rowe and Dani Arribas-Bel provides an excellent introduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial, we have looked at geographically weighted correlation and regression. However, whilst out of the scope of this module, there are many other approaches to account for space in statistical models. Examples of such models are the spatial error model and the spatial lag model.\n\n\nThe spatial error model is used when the error terms in a regression model exhibit spatial autocorrelation, meaning the error terms are not independent across space. This can happen due to omitted variables that have a spatial pattern or unmeasured factors that affect the dependent variable similarly across nearby locations.\nThe model adjusts for spatial autocorrelation by adding a spatially lagged error term (a weighted sum of the errors from neighbouring locations) to the regression equation:\n\\[\ny = X\\beta + \\upsilon, \\upsilon = \\lambda W \\upsilon + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(X\\beta\\) represents the standard regression components, \\(\\lambda\\) is a spatial autoregressive parameter, \\(W\\) is a spatial weights matrix, and \\(\\upsilon\\) is a vector of spatially autocorrelated errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial error models can be fitted using R’s spatialreg package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial lag model is appropriate when the dependent variable itself exhibits spatial dependence. This means the value of the dependent variable in one location depends on the values in neighbouring locations. This model is used to capture the spillover effects or diffusion processes, where the outcome in one area is influenced by outcomes in nearby areas (e.g. house prices, crime rates).\nThe model incorporates a spatially lagged dependent variable, which is the weighted sum of the dependent variable values in neighbouring locations, into the regression equation:\n\\[\ny = \\rho Wy + X\\beta + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the spatial autoregressive coefficient, \\(Wy\\) represents the spatially lagged dependent variable, and \\(X\\beta\\) represents the standard regression components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial lag models can be fitted using R’s spatialreg package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial error model adjusts for spatial autocorrelation in the error terms, whereas the spatial lag model adjusts for spatial dependence in the dependent variable itself. The spatial error model does not alter the interpretation of the coefficients of the independent variables, while the spatial lag model introduces a feedback loop where changes in one area can influence neighbouring areas.\nBoth the spatial error and spatial lag models assume that the relationships between variables are the same across the study area, with adjustments made only for spatial dependencies. GWR, on the other hand, allows the relationships themselves to vary across space. GWR is more flexible but also more complex and computationally intensive, providing local instead of global estimates of coefficients."

Let us compare our map to a map with the same values which have been randomly permutated:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# seed for reproducibility of random permutation\nset.seed(99)\n\n# random permutation\nlsoa21 &lt;- lsoa21 |&gt;\n  mutate(asian_bangladeshi_random = sample(lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi, replace = FALSE))\n\n# shape,\ntm_shape(lsoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"asian_bangladeshi_random\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      breaks = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8),\n      values = c(\"#f0f9e8\", \"#bae4bc\", \"#43a2ca\", \"#0868ac\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Proportion\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportions of people that self-identify as Asian-Bangladeshi with randomly permutated values.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at Figure 2, even with the values being randomly permuted, certain patterns seem to emerge. This observation raises an important question: to what extent are the patterns that we see in the actual data actually present? A widely used method to quantify the similarity between neighbouring locations is by calculating Moran’s I statistic. This measure assesses spatial autocorrelation, indicating the degree to which values of a variable cluster spatially — either through similar (positive spatial autocorrelation) or contrasting values (negative spatial autocorrelation).\nUnderlying our Moran’s I test is the concept of a spatial lag. A spatial lag refers to a concept in spatial analysis where the value of a variable at a given location is influenced by the values of the same variable at neighboring locations. Essentially, it captures the idea that observations in close proximity are likely to be correlated, meaning that what happens in one area can ‘lag’ into or affect nearby areas. The Moran’s I statistic tries to capture the relationship between a value and its spatial lag. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is applied, after both variables have been transformed to z-scores, to fit the data and produce a slope, which determines the Moran’s I statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatter plot of spatially lagged income (neighboring income) versus each areas income. Source: Manuel Gimond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoran’s I values typically range from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\):\n\n+1: Indicates perfect positive spatial autocorrelation. High values cluster near other high values, and low values near other low values.\n0: Suggests no spatial autocorrelation, meaning the spatial distribution of the variable is random.\n-1: Indicates perfect negative spatial autocorrelation. High values cluster near low values, and vice versa (a checkerboard pattern).\n\n\n\n\nThere are two approaches to estimating the significance of the Moran’s I statistic: an analytical method and a computational method. The analytical method relies on assumptions about the data, such as normality, which can sometimes limit its reliability. In contrast, the computational method, which is preferred here, does not make such assumptions and offers a more flexible and robust evaluation of significance.\nThe computational approach is based on a repeated random permutation of the observed values. The Moran’s I statistic is then calculated for each of these randomly reshuffled data sets, generating a reference distribution. By comparing the observed Moran’s I value to this reference distribution, we can assess whether our observed statistic is typical or an outlier and calculate a psuedo \\(p\\)-value (see Figure 4). If the observed Moran’s I value is an outlier, meaning it falls outside the range expected from random data distribution, it suggests a significant degree of clustering in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Determining significance using a Monte Carlo simulation. Source: Manuel Gimond.\n\n\n\n\nWe can derive a pseudo-\\(p\\) value from these simulation results as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{N_{extreme} + 1}{N + 1}\n\\]\nwhere \\({N_{extreme}}\\) is the number of simulated Moran’s I values that were more extreme than our observed statistic and \\({N}\\) is the total number of simulations. In the example shown in Figure 4, only 1 out the 199 simulations was more extreme than the observed local Moran’s I statistic. Therefore \\({N_{extreme}}\\) = 1 , so \\(p\\) is equal to \\((1+1) / (199 + 1) = 0.01\\). This means that there is a one percent probability that we would be wrong in rejecting the null hypothesis of spatial randomness.\n\n\n\nIf the purpose of a Moran’s I test is to quantify how similar places are to their neighbours, the first step is to define what constitutes a neighbour. This definition is not necessarily straightforward, because ‘neighbouring’ observations can be determined in various ways, based on either geometry or proximity. The most common methods include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nContiguity\nSpatial units are considered neighbours if their polygon boundaries touch.\n\n\nFixed Distance\nSpatial units are considered neighbours if they fall within a specified distance.\n\n\nNearest Neighbours\nSpatial units are considered neighbours if they are among the closest neighbours.\n\n\n\nTo capture this information, we need to formalise the spatial relationships within our data by constructing a spatial weights matrix (\\(W_{ij}\\)). This matrix defines which units are neighbours based on our chosen criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following example, neighbours are defined as places that share a border (i.e., they are contiguous). Currently, it is sufficient for them to meet at a single point — so if two places are triangular, touching corners would count them as neighbours. If, however, you require them to share an edge, rather than just a corner, you can modify the default argument by setting queen = FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create neighbour list\nlsoa21_nb &lt;- poly2nb(lsoa21, queen = TRUE)\n\n# inspect\nsummary(lsoa21_nb)\n\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 4994 \nNumber of nonzero links: 29472 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 0.1181714 \nAverage number of links: 5.901482 \nLink number distribution:\n\n   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16 \n   3   19  185  670 1244 1331  841  404  185   70   21   13    3    1    2    1 \n  20 \n   1 \n3 least connected regions:\n2329 3915 4440 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n4990 with 20 links\n\n\nThe neighbour list object is a sparse matrix that lists the neighboring polygons for each LSOA. This matrix represents the spatial relationships between LSOAs, where each entry indicates which polygons share boundaries. These neighborhood relationships can be visualised as a graph by extracting the coordinate points of the centroids of the polygons representing each LSOA:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the neighborhood definition you choose, it is important to verify the results, particularly when using contiguity-based approaches. If your spatial file has issues such as polygons that appear adjacent but do not actually share a border, your results may be inaccurate. You could increase the default value of the snap distance parameter in the poly2nb() function to include these polygons only separated by small gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract centroids from polygons\nlsoa21_cent &lt;- st_centroid(lsoa21, of_largest_polygon = TRUE)\n\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\n# plot graph\npar(mai = c(0, 0, 0, 0))\nplot(st_geometry(lsoa21), border = \"#cccccc\")\nplot(lsoa21_nb, st_geometry(lsoa21_cent), add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Neighbourhood graph using queen contiguity.\n\n\n\n\nWith nearly 5,000 LSOAs, the neighbourhood graph appears quite crowded. However, it seems acceptable, with no noticeable gaps and a dense network of neighbours in Central London, where many smaller LSOAs are located.\n\n\n\nThe neighbourhood list simply identifies which areas (polygons) are neighbours, but spatial weights take this a step further by assigning a weight to each neighbourhood connection. This is important because not all polygons have the same number of neighbours. To ensure that our spatially lagged values are comparable across neighbourhoods of different sizes, standardisation is required. The code below uses style = 'W' to row-standardise the values: if an LSOA has five neighbours, the value of the spatially lagged variable will be the average of that variable across those five neighbours, with each neighbour receiving equal weight.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create spatial weights matrix\nlsoa21_nb_weights &lt;- lsoa21_nb |&gt;\n    nb2listw(style = \"W\")\n\n# inspect - neigbhours of polygon '10'\nlsoa21_nb_weights$neighbours[[10]]\n\n\n[1]    6    7    9 3557 3559 3560 3561\n\n# inspect - weights of neighbours of polygon '10'\nlsoa21_nb_weights$weights[[10]]\n\n[1] 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all places have neighbours. Islands, by definition, will not be considered as neighbours using a contiguity approach. If you attempt to create spatial weights using the nb2listw() function with a neighbourhood list that includes places without neighbours, you will encounter an error message. Potential solutions include using a different neighbourhood definition (e.g. \\(k\\)-nearest neighbours) or manually editing the neighbourhood file if you wish to include these polygons. Alternatively, you can leave it as is but then you must specify the argument zero.policy = TRUE in nb2listw() to allow for empty sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that everything is in place, we can begin by plotting the proportion of people without schooling against the spatially lagged values:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# moran's plot\nmoran.plot(lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi, listw = lsoa21_nb_weights, xlab = \"Variable: Asian-Bangladeshi\",\n    ylab = \"Spatially Lagged Variable: Asian Bangladeshi\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Plot of lagged values versus polygon values.\n\n\n\n\nWe observe a positive relationship between our asian_bangladeshi variable and the spatially lagged values, suggesting that our global Moran’s I test will likely yield a statistic reflective of the slope visible in the scatter plot.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# moran's test\nmoran &lt;- moran.mc(lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi, listw = lsoa21_nb_weights, nsim = 999)\n\n# results\nmoran\n\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi \nweights: lsoa21_nb_weights  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.84992, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\nThe results of the Monte Carlo simulation, visualised in Figure 7, suggest that there is statistically significant positive autocorrelation in our variable. This indicates that LSOAs with higher percentages of people that self-identify as Asian-Bangladeshi tend to be surrounded by other LSOAS with similarly high percentages. Likewise, LSOAs with lower percentages of people that self-identify as Asian Bangladeshi are generally surrounded by LSOAs with similarly low values.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# permutation distribution\nplot(moran, main = \"\", xlab = \"Variable: Asian-Bangladeshi\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Density plot of permutation outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we have established that there is positive spatial autocorrelation in our data, we still need to identify the specific spatial patterns. Looking back at Figure 3, you will notice that the plot is divided into four quadrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadrant\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTop-right quadrant\nThis area represents LSOAs that have a higher-than-average share of the population without schooling and are surrounded by other LSOAs with similarly high shares of the population without schooling. These are known as high-high clusters.\n\n\nBottom-left quadrant\nThis area represents LSOAs with a lower-than-average share of the population without schooling, surrounded by other LSOAs with similarly low shares. These are low-low clusters.\n\n\nTop-left quadrant\nLSOAs with a higher-than-average share of the population without schooling surrounded by LSOAs with a lower-than-average share.

To correct for this, you can adjust the \\(p\\)-values using R’s p.adjust() function. For further details, refer to Manual Gimond’s explanation of the multiple comparison problem in the context of the pseudo-\\(p\\) values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny statistic that includes spatial weights is dependent upon how those weights are defined. We have so far used first order contiguity, i.e. polygons that share a boundary, but there is no particular reason why we should not include second order contiguity polygons (i.e. neighbours of neighbours), use a fixed distance neighbours definitions, or adopt a \\(k\\) nearest neighbours definition. Try to do the following:\n\nExtract the centroids from the lsoa21 file.\nIdentify the 5 nearest neighbours for each LSOA, using the knearneigh() function.\nCreate a neigbhour list of these nearest neighbours, using the knn2nb() function.\nCompute the Global Moran’s I of the asian_indian variable using this new neighbourhood definition.\nMap the statistically significant clusters of Local Moran’s I based on this new neighbourhood definition.\nCompare these results to the output of our asian_bangladeshi values. Do both variables exhibit clustering? Are the clusters located in similar areas?\n\n\n\n\nAnd that is how you can measure spatial dependence in your dataset through different spatial autocorrelation measures. Next week we will focus on the last topic within our set of core spatial analysis methods and techniques, but this week we have covered enough! Probably time to get back to that pesky reading list."

    "text": "This week, we will investigate to what extent people in London who self-identified as Asian-Bangladeshi in the 2021 Census are clustered in London at the LSOA-level. The data covers all usual residents, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn LSOA is a geographic unit used in the UK for statistical analysis. It typically represents small areas with populations of around 1,000 to 3,000 people and is designed to ensure consistent data reporting. LSOAs are commonly used to report on census data, deprivation indices, and other socio-economic statistics.\n\n\n\nThe data has been extracted using the Custom Dataset Tool and subsequently processed to include only the proportion of individuals who self-identify as belonging to one of the Asian groups defined in the Census.

Let us compare our map to a map with the same values which have been randomly permutated:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# seed for reproducibility of random permutation\nset.seed(99)\n\n# random permutation\nlsoa21 &lt;- lsoa21 |&gt;\n  mutate(asian_bangladeshi_random = sample(lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi, replace = FALSE))\n\n# shape,\ntm_shape(lsoa21) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    # map data\n    fill = \"asian_bangladeshi_random\",\n    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n      breaks = c(0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8),\n      values = c(\"#f0f9e8\", \"#bae4bc\", \"#43a2ca\", \"#0868ac\"),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    fill.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"Proportion\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    ),\n\n    # borders\n    col = \"#ffffff\",\n    col_alpha = 0.3,\n    lwd = 0.1\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.85, 0.25),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Proportions of people that self-identify as Asian-Bangladeshi with randomly permutated values.\n\n\n\n\nLooking at Figure 2, even with the values being randomly permuted, certain patterns seem to emerge. This observation raises an important question: to what extent are the patterns that we see in the actual data actually present? A widely used method to quantify the similarity between neighbouring locations is by calculating Moran’s I statistic. This measure assesses spatial autocorrelation, indicating the degree to which values of a variable cluster spatially — either through similar (positive spatial autocorrelation) or contrasting values (negative spatial autocorrelation).\nUnderlying our Moran’s I test is the concept of a spatial lag. A spatial lag refers to a concept in spatial analysis where the value of a variable at a given location is influenced by the values of the same variable at neighboring locations. Essentially, it captures the idea that observations in close proximity are likely to be correlated, meaning that what happens in one area can ‘lag’ into or affect nearby areas. The Moran’s I statistic tries to capture the relationship between a value and its spatial lag. An Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is applied, after both variables have been transformed to z-scores, to fit the data and produce a slope, which determines the Moran’s I statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatter plot of spatially lagged income (neighboring income) versus each areas income. Source: Manuel Gimond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoran’s I values typically range from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\):\n\n+1: Indicates perfect positive spatial autocorrelation. High values cluster near other high values, and low values near other low values.\n0: Suggests no spatial autocorrelation, meaning the spatial distribution of the variable is random.\n-1: Indicates perfect negative spatial autocorrelation. High values cluster near low values, and vice versa (a checkerboard pattern).\n\n\n\n\nThere are two approaches to estimating the significance of the Moran’s I statistic: an analytical method and a computational method. The analytical method relies on assumptions about the data, such as normality, which can sometimes limit its reliability. In contrast, the computational method, which is preferred here, does not make such assumptions and offers a more flexible and robust evaluation of significance.\nThe computational approach is based on a repeated random permutation of the observed values. The Moran’s I statistic is then calculated for each of these randomly reshuffled data sets, generating a reference distribution. By comparing the observed Moran’s I value to this reference distribution, we can assess whether our observed statistic is typical or an outlier and calculate a psuedo \\(p\\)-value (see Figure 4). If the observed Moran’s I value is an outlier, meaning it falls outside the range expected from random data distribution, it suggests a significant degree of clustering in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Determining significance using a Monte Carlo simulation. Source: Manuel Gimond.\n\n\n\n\nWe can derive a pseudo-\\(p\\) value from these simulation results as follows:\n\\[\n\\frac{N_{extreme} + 1}{N + 1}\n\\]\nwhere \\({N_{extreme}}\\) is the number of simulated Moran’s I values that were more extreme than our observed statistic and \\({N}\\) is the total number of simulations. In the example shown in Figure 4, only 1 out the 199 simulations was more extreme than the observed local Moran’s I statistic. Therefore \\({N_{extreme}}\\) = 1 , so \\(p\\) is equal to \\((1+1) / (199 + 1) = 0.01\\). This means that there is a one percent probability that we would be wrong in rejecting the null hypothesis of spatial randomness.\n\n\n\nIf the purpose of a Moran’s I test is to quantify how similar places are to their neighbours, the first step is to define what constitutes a neighbour. This definition is not necessarily straightforward, because ‘neighbouring’ observations can be determined in various ways, based on either geometry or proximity. The most common methods include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nContiguity\nSpatial units are considered neighbours if their polygon boundaries touch.\n\n\nFixed Distance\nSpatial units are considered neighbours if they fall within a specified distance.\n\n\nNearest Neighbours\nSpatial units are considered neighbours if they are among the closest neighbours.\n\n\n\nTo capture this information, we need to formalise the spatial relationships within our data by constructing a spatial weights matrix (\\(W_{ij}\\)). This matrix defines which units are neighbours based on our chosen criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following example, neighbours are defined as places that share a border (i.e., they are contiguous). Currently, it is sufficient for them to meet at a single point — so if two places are triangular, touching corners would count them as neighbours. If, however, you require them to share an edge, rather than just a corner, you can modify the default argument by setting queen = FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create neighbour list\nlsoa21_nb &lt;- poly2nb(lsoa21, queen = TRUE)\n\n# inspect\nsummary(lsoa21_nb)\n\n\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 4994 \nNumber of nonzero links: 29472 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 0.1181714 \nAverage number of links: 5.901482 \nLink number distribution:\n\n   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16 \n   3   19  185  670 1244 1331  841  404  185   70   21   13    3    1    2    1 \n  20 \n   1 \n3 least connected regions:\n2329 3915 4440 with 1 link\n1 most connected region:\n4990 with 20 links\n\n\nThe neighbour list object is a sparse matrix that lists the neighboring polygons for each LSOA. This matrix represents the spatial relationships between LSOAs, where each entry indicates which polygons share boundaries. These neighborhood relationships can be visualised as a graph by extracting the coordinate points of the centroids of the polygons representing each LSOA:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the neighborhood definition you choose, it is important to verify the results, particularly when using contiguity-based approaches. If your spatial file has issues such as polygons that appear adjacent but do not actually share a border, your results may be inaccurate. You could increase the default value of the snap distance parameter in the poly2nb() function to include these polygons only separated by small gaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract centroids from polygons\nlsoa21_cent &lt;- st_centroid(lsoa21, of_largest_polygon = TRUE)\n\n\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n\n# plot graph\npar(mai = c(0, 0, 0, 0))\nplot(st_geometry(lsoa21), border = \"#cccccc\")\nplot(lsoa21_nb, st_geometry(lsoa21_cent), add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Neighbourhood graph using queen contiguity.\n\n\n\n\nWith nearly 5,000 LSOAs, the neighbourhood graph appears quite crowded. However, it seems acceptable, with no noticeable gaps and a dense network of neighbours in Central London, where many smaller LSOAs are located.\n\n\n\nThe neighbourhood list simply identifies which areas (polygons) are neighbours, but spatial weights take this a step further by assigning a weight to each neighbourhood connection. This is important because not all polygons have the same number of neighbours. To ensure that our spatially lagged values are comparable across neighbourhoods of different sizes, standardisation is required. The code below uses style = 'W' to row-standardise the values: if an LSOA has five neighbours, the value of the spatially lagged variable will be the average of that variable across those five neighbours, with each neighbour receiving equal weight.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create spatial weights matrix\nlsoa21_nb_weights &lt;- lsoa21_nb |&gt;\n    nb2listw(style = \"W\")\n\n# inspect - neigbhours of polygon '10'\nlsoa21_nb_weights$neighbours[[10]]\n\n\n[1]    6    7    9 3557 3559 3560 3561\n\n# inspect - weights of neighbours of polygon '10'\nlsoa21_nb_weights$weights[[10]]\n\n[1] 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571 0.1428571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all places have neighbours. Islands, by definition, will not be considered as neighbours using a contiguity approach. If you attempt to create spatial weights using the nb2listw() function with a neighbourhood list that includes places without neighbours, you will encounter an error message. Potential solutions include using a different neighbourhood definition (e.g. \\(k\\)-nearest neighbours) or manually editing the neighbourhood file if you wish to include these polygons. Alternatively, you can leave it as is but then you must specify the argument zero.policy = TRUE in nb2listw() to allow for empty sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that everything is in place, we can begin by plotting the proportion of people without schooling against the spatially lagged values:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# moran's plot\nmoran.plot(lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi, listw = lsoa21_nb_weights, xlab = \"Variable: Asian-Bangladeshi\",\n    ylab = \"Spatially Lagged Variable: Asian Bangladeshi\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Plot of lagged values versus polygon values.\n\n\n\n\nWe observe a positive relationship between our asian_bangladeshi variable and the spatially lagged values, suggesting that our global Moran’s I test will likely yield a statistic reflective of the slope visible in the scatter plot.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# moran's test\nmoran &lt;- moran.mc(lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi, listw = lsoa21_nb_weights, nsim = 999)\n\n# results\nmoran\n\n\n\n    Monte-Carlo simulation of Moran I\n\ndata:  lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi \nweights: lsoa21_nb_weights  \nnumber of simulations + 1: 1000 \n\nstatistic = 0.84992, observed rank = 1000, p-value = 0.001\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n\n\nThe results of the Monte Carlo simulation, visualised in Figure 7, suggest that there is statistically significant positive autocorrelation in our variable. This indicates that LSOAs with higher percentages of people that self-identify as Asian-Bangladeshi tend to be surrounded by other LSOAS with similarly high percentages. Likewise, LSOAs with lower percentages of people that self-identify as Asian Bangladeshi are generally surrounded by LSOAs with similarly low values.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# permutation distribution\nplot(moran, main = \"\", xlab = \"Variable: Asian-Bangladeshi\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Density plot of permutation outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we have established that there is positive spatial autocorrelation in our data, we still need to identify the specific spatial patterns. Looking back at Figure 3, you will notice that the plot is divided into four quadrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuadrant\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTop-right quadrant\nThis area represents LSOAs that have a higher-than-average share of the population without schooling and are surrounded by other LSOAs with similarly high shares of the population without schooling. These are known as high-high clusters.\n\n\nBottom-left quadrant\nThis area represents LSOAs with a lower-than-average share of the population without schooling, surrounded by other LSOAs with similarly low shares. These are low-low clusters.\n\n\nTop-left quadrant\nLSOAs with a higher-than-average share of the population without schooling surrounded by LSOAs with a lower-than-average share. These are high-low clusters.\n\n\nBottom-right quadrant\nLSOAs with a lower-than-average share of the population without schooling surrounded by LSOAs with a higher-than-average share. These are low-high clusters.\n\n\n\nWe can show these area on a map by deconstructing the Moran’s I into a series of local Moran values, each measuring how similar each place is (individually) to its neighbours.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# local moran's test\nlmoran &lt;- localmoran_perm(lsoa21$asian_bangladeshi, listw = lsoa21_nb_weights, nsim = 999)\n\n# results\nhead(lmoran)\n\n\n          Ii          E.Ii     Var.Ii      Z.Ii Pr(z != E(Ii))\n1 0.15069391 -0.0032726893 0.03484206 0.8248493   4.094572e-01\n2 0.13225460 -0.0016613502 0.03507478 0.7150473   4.745798e-01\n3 0.09935974 -0.0009791708 0.02573120 0.6255173   5.316316e-01\n4 4.20123420 -0.0098905991 1.02079945 4.1680018   3.072815e-05\n5 2.21814457  0.0064109676 0.29187729 4.0938570   4.242561e-05\n6 1.07427412  0.0125602786 0.17292266 2.5531805   1.067442e-02\n  Pr(z != E(Ii)) Sim Pr(folded) Sim  Skewness Kurtosis\n1              0.130          0.065 -1.903886 3.970373\n2              0.346          0.173 -1.949852 4.028935\n3              0.650          0.325 -1.874507 4.017294\n4              0.010          0.005  1.618687 2.813289\n5              0.010          0.005  2.054221 4.456165\n6              0.060          0.030  1.563633 2.379143\n\n\nWe are not given a single statistic as we did with our global Moran’s I, but rather we get a table of different statistics that are all related back to each of the LSOAs in our dataset.

To correct for this, you can adjust the \\(p\\)-values using R’s p.adjust() function.

In such cases, R cannot determine which one to use. To resolve this, you can specify the library explicitly by using janitor::clean_names().\n\n\n\nThe column names are rather long, so let’s rename these manually:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# rename columns\nnames(lsoa_eth)[2:20] &lt;- c(\"Asian - Bangladeshi\", \"Asian - Chinese\", \"Asian - Indian\",\n    \"Asian - Pakistani\", \"Asian - Other\", \"Black - African\", \"Black - Caribbean\",\n    \"Black - Other\", \"Mixed - Asian\", \"Mixed - Black African\", \"Mixed - Black Carribean\",\n    \"Mixed - Other\", \"White - British\", \"White - Irish\", \"White - Traveller\", \"White - Roma\",\n    \"White - Other\", \"Arab - Other\", \"Any Other Group\")\n\n\nThe last thing we need to do is extract the LSOAs that fall within the 12 Inner London Boroughs. We can do this by using the LSOA names that are inside the spatial dataframe:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# boroughs\ninner_boroughs &lt;- c(\"Camden\", \"Greenwich\", \"Hackney\", \"Hammersmith and Fulham\", \"Islington\", \"Kensington and Chelsea\", \"Lambeth\", \"Lewisham\", \"Southwark\", \"Tower Hamlets\", \"Wandsworth\", \"Westminster\")\n\n# filter spatial data\nlsoa21_inner &lt;- lsoa21 |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(lsoa21nm, paste(inner_boroughs, collapse = \"|\")))\n\n# filter attribute data, add lsoa names\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  filter(lower_layer_super_output_areas_code %in% lsoa21_inner$lsoa21cd)\n\n# add lsoa names\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa21[1:2], by = c(\"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\" = \"lsoa21cd\"))\n\n# inspect\nlsoa_eth\n\n\n# A tibble: 1,792 × 22\n# Rowwise: \n   lower_layer_super_output_areas_code `Asian - Bangladeshi` `Asian - Chinese`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                               &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 E01000842                                         0.00209            0.0265\n 2 E01000843                                         0.00167            0.0301\n 3 E01000844                                         0.00614            0.0258\n 4 E01000845                                         0.0193             0.0273\n 5 E01000846                                         0.0586             0.0179\n 6 E01000847                                         0.0506             0.0312\n 7 E01000848                                         0.00269            0.0249\n 8 E01000849                                         0.0125             0.0249\n 9 E01000850                                         0.0218             0.113 \n10 E01000851                                         0.0216             0.0824\n# ℹ 1,782 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: `Asian - Indian` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Asian - Pakistani` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Asian - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Black - African` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Black - Caribbean` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Black - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Mixed - Asian` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Mixed - Black African` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Mixed - Black Carribean` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Mixed - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - British` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - Irish` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `White - Traveller` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - Roma` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what the paste(inner_boroughs, collapse = '|') code does, you can run it separately in the console to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 library is built on the layered grammar of graphics, which provides a structured approach to creating visualisations. This means that plots are constructed by adding layers, such as data, aesthetic mappings (e.g., axes, colours, sizes), geometric shapes (e.g., points, lines, bars), and optional elements like themes or statistical transformations. This modular design allows users to build complex and customisable plots step by step, ensuring flexibility and clarity in the visualisation process.\nLet’s try to use this approach by making a boxplot on the distribution of people that self-identify as White British across all Inner London Boroughs. With ggplot2, every plot begins with the ggplot() function, which creates a coordinate system to which layers can be added. The first argument of ggplot() specifies the dataset to use:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth)\n\n\nTo build your graph, you add one or more layers to ggplot(). For instance, geom_point() adds a layer of points to create a scatterplot. ggplot2 provides many geom functions, each adding a different type of layer to your plot. To create a boxplot, you add the geom_boxplot() layer. For boxplots, the mapping argument defines how dataset variables are linked to visual properties, such as the grouping or value axes. The mapping is paired with aes(), where y specifies the numeric variable:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Basic boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn aesthetic is a visual property of the elements in your plot. Aesthetics include attributes like size, shape, or colour of points. By modifying the values of these aesthetic properties, you can display a point in various ways, allowing for greater customisation and clarity in your visualisation.\n\n\n\nJust like with tmap, we can customise the basic plot by styling the boxplot, adding labels, and adjusting its overall appearancs:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    color = \"#252525\",\n    outlier.color = \"#ef3b2c\",\n    linewidth = 0.5,\n    staplewidth = 0.5,\n    outlier.shape = 16,\n    outlier.size = 2\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"#969696\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"#d9d9d9\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stylised boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nBut what if we wwant to create a boxplot for all Inner London Boroughs? We can do this by adding a grouping variable:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# add borough names\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  mutate(borough_name = substr(lsoa21nm, 1, nchar(lsoa21nm) - 5))\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`, y = borough_name)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    color = \"#252525\",\n    outlier.color = \"#ef3b2c\",\n    linewidth = 0.5,\n    staplewidth = 0.5,\n    utlier.shape = 16,\n    outlier.size = 2\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    y = \"Borough\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"#969696\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"#d9d9d9\")\n  )\n\n\nWarning in geom_boxplot(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = \"#252525\", outlier.color =\n\"#ef3b2c\", : Ignoring unknown parameters: `utlier.shape`\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Stylised boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nThe boroughs are drawn in alphabetical order by default. To change this we need to adjust the order by creating a factor. For instance, we can sort the boroughs by their median values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, a factor is a data structure used to represent categorical variables with a specific order or grouping. Factors allow you to define and manipulate the order of categories, which is especially useful for plotting or analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# median values\nlsoa_med &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(median = median(`White - British`))\n\n# create factor\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  mutate(borough_name_factor = factor(borough_name, levels = lsoa_med$borough_name[order(lsoa_med$median, decreasing = TRUE)]))\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`, y = borough_name_factor)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    color = \"#252525\",\n    outlier.color = \"#ef3b2c\",\n    linewidth = 0.5,\n    staplewidth = 0.5,\n    outlier.shape = 16,\n    outlier.size = 2\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    y = \"Borough\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"#969696\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"#d9d9d9\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stylised boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots are effective for visualising distributions, but histograms offer another way to explore the same data by showing the frequency of values. While histograms cannot be displayed alongside boxplots in the same image, we can create a series of histograms, each displayed in a separate panel. These panels can show the distributions for different groups, such as individual boroughs.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_histogram() +\n  # create panels\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~borough_name,\n    ncol = 4,\n    nrow = 3\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    y = \"Number of LSOAs\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n  )\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Histograms presented in individual panels.\n\n\n\n\nWe could use the same approach to create a series of scatterplots to show the relationship between two variables:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`, y = `White - Other`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_point() +\n  # create panels\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~borough_name,\n    ncol = 4,\n    nrow = 3\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Scatterplots presented in individual panels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo export a ggplot, first assign your plot to an object. Then, use the ggsave() function to save the plot to a file, specifying the desired filename and format (e.g. .png or .pdf). You can specify the dimensions of the output using the width and height arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flexibility of ggplot2 extends beyond traditional plots through additional libraries that expand its functionality, allowing you to create specialised visualisations. For instance, we can use the treemapify library to create a treemap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA treemap is a data visualisation that displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles, with each rectangle representing a category or subcategory. The size of each rectangle is proportional to a specific variable, often reflecting values such as frequency or proportion, making it easier to compare the relative sizes of different elements. Treemaps are particularly useful for visualising large datasets with multiple categories or subcategories in a compact, space-efficient layout.\n\n\n\nLet’s try to create a treemap of the mean share of different population groups in the borough of Lambeth. We first need to calculate the mean of each population group in Lambeth and then transform the data from a wide format to a long format so that all proportions are in the same column.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# mean group values lambeth\nlambeth_mean &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    filter(borough_name == \"Lambeth\") |&gt;\n    group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n    summarise(across(2:20, mean))\n\n# wide to long\nlambeth_mean &lt;- lambeth_mean |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(cols = 2:20, names_to = \"population_group\", values_to = \"proportion\")\n\n\nWe can now visualise the share of each population group in Lambeth using a treemap:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lambeth_mean, aes(area = proportion, fill = population_group, label = population_group)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_treemap() +\n  # add text\n  geom_treemap_text(\n    colour = \"white\",\n    place = \"centre\",\n    grow = TRUE,\n    min.size = 8\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Treemap of relative share of population groups in Lambeth.\n\n\n\n\nWe could create facets for these treemaps, but we can also use subgroups to create a nested representation of our data - weighted by the total population in each London borough.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# mean group values london\nlondon_mean &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n    summarise(across(2:20, mean))\n\n# total group values london\nlondon_sum &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n    summarise(borough_population = sum(eth_pop))\n\n# wide to long,\nlondon_mean &lt;- london_mean |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(cols = 2:20, names_to = \"population_group\", values_to = \"proportion\")\n\n# add total population, weigh\nlondon_mean &lt;- london_mean |&gt;\n    left_join(london_sum, by = c(borough_name = \"borough_name\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(proportion_weighted = proportion * borough_population)\n\n\nNow the data have been prepared, we can create a treemap again as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = london_mean, aes(area = proportion_weighted, fill = population_group, label = population_group, subgroup = borough_name)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_treemap() +\n  # add text\n  geom_treemap_text(\n    colour = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    place = \"centre\",\n    grow = TRUE,\n    min.size = 8,\n  ) +\n  # add border\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(\n    colour = \"#000000\"\n  ) +\n  # add text\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_text(\n    colour = \"#636363\",\n    place = \"bottomleft\",\n    size = 14,\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    padding.x = grid::unit(2, \"mm\"),\n    padding.y = grid::unit(2, \"mm\"),\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Treemap of relative share of population groups in London, organised by borough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 library supports a wide variety of chart types, all based on the same core principles of layering elements such as data, aesthetics, and geometric shapes. So far, we have worked with boxplots, scatterplots, histograms, and treemaps. However, ggplot2 also offers many other geometries, including spatial geometries, that you can use to create more diverse visualisations.\nUsing the lsoa_eth dataset try to to complete the following tasks:\n\nCreate a violin plot: A violin plot combines aspects of a boxplot and a density plot, offering a compact view of the distribution of continuous data. Use the geom_violin() function to visualise the distribution of the self-identified Asian Bangladeshi population for each of the Inner London boroughs.\nCreate a map: Use the geom_sf() function to map the distribution of the self-identified Black Caribbean population across Greater London.\nCreate a faceted map: Create a faceted map showing the distribution of the self-identified Asian Bangladeshi, Asian Chinese, Black African, and White British populations across London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help you get familiar with ggplot2 and its principles, you can use the esquisse library, which allows you to interactively create plots and generate the corresponding ggplot2 code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is it for today, and indeed, you have now reached the end of Geocomputation! Over the course of this module, we have explored the fundamental principles of spatial analysis, data visualisation, and reproducible research. It is now inevitable: time for that reading list."

In such cases, R cannot determine which one to use. To resolve this, you can specify the library explicitly by using janitor::clean_names().\n\n\n\nThe column names are rather long, so let’s rename these manually:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# rename columns\nnames(lsoa_eth)[2:20] &lt;- c(\"Asian - Bangladeshi\", \"Asian - Chinese\", \"Asian - Indian\",\n    \"Asian - Pakistani\", \"Asian - Other\", \"Black - African\", \"Black - Caribbean\",\n    \"Black - Other\", \"Mixed - Asian\", \"Mixed - Black African\", \"Mixed - Black Carribean\",\n    \"Mixed - Other\", \"White - British\", \"White - Irish\", \"White - Traveller\", \"White - Roma\",\n    \"White - Other\", \"Arab - Other\", \"Any Other Group\")\n\n\nThe last thing we need to do is extract the LSOAs that fall within the 12 Inner London Boroughs. We can do this by using the LSOA names that are inside the spatial dataframe:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# boroughs\ninner_boroughs &lt;- c(\"Camden\", \"Greenwich\", \"Hackney\", \"Hammersmith and Fulham\", \"Islington\", \"Kensington and Chelsea\", \"Lambeth\", \"Lewisham\", \"Southwark\", \"Tower Hamlets\", \"Wandsworth\", \"Westminster\")\n\n# filter spatial data\nlsoa21_inner &lt;- lsoa21 |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(lsoa21nm, paste(inner_boroughs, collapse = \"|\")))\n\n# filter attribute data, add lsoa names\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  filter(lower_layer_super_output_areas_code %in% lsoa21_inner$lsoa21cd)\n\n# add lsoa names\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  left_join(lsoa21[1:2], by = c(\"lower_layer_super_output_areas_code\" = \"lsoa21cd\"))\n\n# inspect\nlsoa_eth\n\n\n# A tibble: 1,792 × 22\n# Rowwise: \n   lower_layer_super_output_areas_code `Asian - Bangladeshi` `Asian - Chinese`\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                               &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 E01000842                                         0.00209            0.0265\n 2 E01000843                                         0.00167            0.0301\n 3 E01000844                                         0.00614            0.0258\n 4 E01000845                                         0.0193             0.0273\n 5 E01000846                                         0.0586             0.0179\n 6 E01000847                                         0.0506             0.0312\n 7 E01000848                                         0.00269            0.0249\n 8 E01000849                                         0.0125             0.0249\n 9 E01000850                                         0.0218             0.113 \n10 E01000851                                         0.0216             0.0824\n# ℹ 1,782 more rows\n# ℹ 19 more variables: `Asian - Indian` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Asian - Pakistani` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Asian - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Black - African` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Black - Caribbean` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Black - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Mixed - Asian` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Mixed - Black African` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Mixed - Black Carribean` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Mixed - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - British` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - Irish` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `White - Traveller` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - Roma` &lt;dbl&gt;, `White - Other` &lt;dbl&gt;, …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what the paste(inner_boroughs, collapse = '|') code does, you can run it separately in the console to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 library is built on the layered grammar of graphics, which provides a structured approach to creating visualisations. This means that plots are constructed by adding layers, such as data, aesthetic mappings (e.g., axes, colours, sizes), geometric shapes (e.g., points, lines, bars), and optional elements like themes or statistical transformations. This modular design allows users to build complex and customisable plots step by step, ensuring flexibility and clarity in the visualisation process.\nLet’s try to use this approach by making a boxplot on the distribution of people that self-identify as White British across all Inner London Boroughs. With ggplot2, every plot begins with the ggplot() function, which creates a coordinate system to which layers can be added. The first argument of ggplot() specifies the dataset to use:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth)\n\n\nTo build your graph, you add one or more layers to ggplot(). For instance, geom_point() adds a layer of points to create a scatterplot. ggplot2 provides many geom functions, each adding a different type of layer to your plot. To create a boxplot, you add the geom_boxplot() layer. For boxplots, the mapping argument defines how dataset variables are linked to visual properties, such as the grouping or value axes. The mapping is paired with aes(), where y specifies the numeric variable:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Basic boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn aesthetic is a visual property of the elements in your plot. Aesthetics include attributes like size, shape, or colour of points. By modifying the values of these aesthetic properties, you can display a point in various ways, allowing for greater customisation and clarity in your visualisation.\n\n\n\nJust like with tmap, we can customise the basic plot by styling the boxplot, adding labels, and adjusting its overall appearancs:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    color = \"#252525\",\n    outlier.color = \"#ef3b2c\",\n    linewidth = 0.5,\n    staplewidth = 0.5,\n    outlier.shape = 16,\n    outlier.size = 2\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"#969696\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"#d9d9d9\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stylised boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nBut what if we wwant to create a boxplot for all Inner London Boroughs? We can do this by adding a grouping variable:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# add borough names\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  mutate(borough_name = substr(lsoa21nm, 1, nchar(lsoa21nm) - 5))\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`, y = borough_name)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    color = \"#252525\",\n    outlier.color = \"#ef3b2c\",\n    linewidth = 0.5,\n    staplewidth = 0.5,\n    utlier.shape = 16,\n    outlier.size = 2\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    y = \"Borough\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"#969696\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"#d9d9d9\")\n  )\n\n\nWarning in geom_boxplot(fill = \"#f0f0f0\", color = \"#252525\", outlier.color =\n\"#ef3b2c\", : Ignoring unknown parameters: `utlier.shape`\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Stylised boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nThe boroughs are drawn in alphabetical order by default. To change this we need to adjust the order by creating a factor. For instance, we can sort the boroughs by their median values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, a factor is a data structure used to represent categorical variables with a specific order or grouping. Factors allow you to define and manipulate the order of categories, which is especially useful for plotting or analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# median values\nlsoa_med &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n  summarise(median = median(`White - British`))\n\n# create factor\nlsoa_eth &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n  mutate(borough_name_factor = factor(borough_name, levels = lsoa_med$borough_name[order(lsoa_med$median, decreasing = TRUE)]))\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`, y = borough_name_factor)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_boxplot(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    color = \"#252525\",\n    outlier.color = \"#ef3b2c\",\n    linewidth = 0.5,\n    staplewidth = 0.5,\n    outlier.shape = 16,\n    outlier.size = 2\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    y = \"Borough\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"#969696\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_line(linewidth = 0.2, colour = \"#d9d9d9\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stylised boxplot using ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots are effective for visualising distributions, but histograms offer another way to explore the same data by showing the frequency of values. While histograms cannot be displayed alongside boxplots in the same image, we can create a series of histograms, each displayed in a separate panel. These panels can show the distributions for different groups, such as individual boroughs.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_histogram() +\n  # create panels\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~borough_name,\n    ncol = 4,\n    nrow = 3\n  ) +\n  # add labels\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population self-identifying as White British\",\n    y = \"Number of LSOAs\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n  )\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Histograms presented in individual panels.\n\n\n\n\nWe could use the same approach to create a series of scatterplots to show the relationship between two variables:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lsoa_eth, aes(x = `White - British`, y = `White - Other`)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_point() +\n  # create panels\n  facet_wrap(\n    ~borough_name,\n    ncol = 4,\n    nrow = 3\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_light() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"#34495e\"),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Scatterplots presented in individual panels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo export a ggplot, first assign your plot to an object. Then, use the ggsave() function to save the plot to a file, specifying the desired filename and format (e.g. .png or .pdf). You can specify the dimensions of the output using the width and height arguments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flexibility of ggplot2 extends beyond traditional plots through additional libraries that expand its functionality, allowing you to create specialised visualisations. For instance, we can use the treemapify library to create a treemap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA treemap is a data visualisation that displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles, with each rectangle representing a category or subcategory. The size of each rectangle is proportional to a specific variable, often reflecting values such as frequency or proportion, making it easier to compare the relative sizes of different elements. Treemaps are particularly useful for visualising large datasets with multiple categories or subcategories in a compact, space-efficient layout.\n\n\n\nLet’s try to create a treemap of the mean share of different population groups in the borough of Lambeth. We first need to calculate the mean of each population group in Lambeth and then transform the data from a wide format to a long format so that all proportions are in the same column.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# mean group values lambeth\nlambeth_mean &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    filter(borough_name == \"Lambeth\") |&gt;\n    group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n    summarise(across(2:20, mean))\n\n# wide to long\nlambeth_mean &lt;- lambeth_mean |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(cols = 2:20, names_to = \"population_group\", values_to = \"proportion\")\n\n\nWe can now visualise the share of each population group in Lambeth using a treemap:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = lambeth_mean, aes(area = proportion, fill = population_group, label = population_group)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_treemap() +\n  # add text\n  geom_treemap_text(\n    colour = \"white\",\n    place = \"centre\",\n    grow = TRUE,\n    min.size = 8\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Treemap of relative share of population groups in Lambeth.\n\n\n\n\nWe could create facets for these treemaps, but we can also use subgroups to create a nested representation of our data - weighted by the total population in each London borough.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# mean group values london\nlondon_mean &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n    summarise(across(2:20, mean))\n\n# total group values london\nlondon_sum &lt;- lsoa_eth |&gt;\n    group_by(borough_name) |&gt;\n    summarise(borough_population = sum(eth_pop))\n\n# wide to long,\nlondon_mean &lt;- london_mean |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(cols = 2:20, names_to = \"population_group\", values_to = \"proportion\")\n\n# add total population, weigh\nlondon_mean &lt;- london_mean |&gt;\n    left_join(london_sum, by = c(borough_name = \"borough_name\")) |&gt;\n    mutate(proportion_weighted = proportion * borough_population)\n\n\nNow the data have been prepared, we can create a treemap again as follows:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# initiate ggplot\nggplot(data = london_mean, aes(area = proportion_weighted, fill = population_group, label = population_group, subgroup = borough_name)) +\n  # add geometry\n  geom_treemap() +\n  # add text\n  geom_treemap_text(\n    colour = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    place = \"centre\",\n    grow = TRUE,\n    min.size = 8,\n  ) +\n  # add border\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(\n    colour = \"#000000\"\n  ) +\n  # add text\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_text(\n    colour = \"#636363\",\n    place = \"bottomleft\",\n    size = 14,\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    padding.x = grid::unit(2, \"mm\"),\n    padding.y = grid::unit(2, \"mm\"),\n  ) +\n  # set basic theme\n  theme_minimal() +\n  # customise theme\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Treemap of relative share of population groups in London, organised by borough"

So far, we have worked with boxplots, scatterplots, histograms, and treemaps. However, ggplot2 also offers many other geometries, including spatial geometries, that you can use to create more diverse visualisations.\nUsing the lsoa_eth dataset try to to complete the following tasks:\n\nCreate a violin plot: A violin plot combines aspects of a boxplot and a density plot, offering a compact view of the distribution of continuous data.

We will be using open data from data.police.uk on reported crimes alongside OpenStreetMap data for this analysis. We will use R to directly download the necessary data from OpenStreetMap, but the crime data will need to be manually downloaded from the data portal. We further have access to a GeoPackage that contains the London 2021 MSOA boundaries that we can use as reference layer. If you do not already have it on your computer, save this file in your data/spatial folder.\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon MSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK Police Data Portal allows you to access and generate tabular data for crime recorded in the UK across the different police forces. To download recorded crime data for London:\n\nNavigate to data.police.uk and click on Downloads.\nUnder the data range select January 2023 to December 2023.\nUnder the Custom download tab select Metropolitan Police Service and City of London Police. Leave the other settings unchanged and click on Generate file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Downloading data on reported crimes through data.police.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may take a few minutes for the download to be generated, so be patient. Once the Download now button appears, you can download the dataset.\nAfter downloading, unzip the file. You will find that the zip file contains 12 folders, one for each month of 2023. Each folder includes two files: one for the Metropolitan Police Service and one for the City of London Police.\nCreate a new folder named London-Crime within your data/attributes directory, and copy all 12 folders with the data into this new folder.\n\nTo get started, let us create our first script. File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. Save your script as w02-bike-theft.r.\nWe will start by loading the libraries that we will need:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(osmdata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have to install some of these libraries if you have not used these before.\n\n\n\nAlthough we could read each individual crime file into R one by one and then combine them, we can actually accomplish this in a single step:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# list all csv files\ncrime_df &lt;- list.files(path = \"data/attributes/London-Crime/\", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE) |&gt;\n  # read individual csv files\n  lapply(read_csv) |&gt;\n  # bind together into one\n  bind_rows()\n\n# inspect\nhead(crime_df)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  `Crime ID`      Month `Reported by` `Falls within` Longitude Latitude Location\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 4a14d4745da0a2… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.106     51.5 On or n…\n2 e6e32581c99c5b… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.107     51.5 On or n…\n3 7b7cb8e7debe8b… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.110     51.5 On or n…\n4 f7fc44e1e76332… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.108     51.5 On or n…\n5 8083dafd1770af… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.112     51.5 On or n…\n6 4587239a45f0e8… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.112     51.5 On or n…\n# ℹ 5 more variables: `LSOA code` &lt;chr&gt;, `LSOA name` &lt;chr&gt;, `Crime type` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Last outcome category` &lt;chr&gt;, Context &lt;lgl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your computer, processing this data may take some time due to the large volume involved. Once completed, you should have a dataframe containing 1,144,329 observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can further inspect the object using the View() function.\n\n\n\nThe column names contain spaces and are therefore not easily referenced. We can easily clean this up using the janitor package:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# clean names\ncrime_df &lt;- crime_df |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# inspect\nnames(crime_df)\n\n\n [1] \"crime_id\"              \"month\"                 \"reported_by\"          \n [4] \"falls_within\"          \"longitude\"             \"latitude\"             \n [7] \"location\"              \"lsoa_code\"             \"lsoa_name\"            \n[10] \"crime_type\"            \"last_outcome_category\" \"context\"              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your clean_names() function returns an error, it is likely due to a conflict with another library that also includes a clean_names() function. In such cases, R cannot determine which one to use. To resolve this, you can specify the library explicitly by using janitor::clean_names().\n\n\n\nFor our analysis, we are currently only interested in reported bicycle thefts, so we need to filter our data based on the crime_type column. We can start by examining the unique values in this column and then subset the data accordingly:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# unique types\nunique(crime_df$crime_type)\n\n\n [1] \"Other theft\"                  \"Other crime\"                 \n [3] \"Theft from the person\"        \"Public order\"                \n [5] \"Anti-social behaviour\"        \"Burglary\"                    \n [7] \"Criminal damage and arson\"    \"Drugs\"                       \n [9] \"Shoplifting\"                  \"Vehicle crime\"               \n[11] \"Violence and sexual offences\" \"Bicycle theft\"               \n[13] \"Robbery\"                      \"Possession of weapons\"       \n\n# filter\ntheft_bike &lt;- crime_df |&gt;\n    filter(crime_type == \"Bicycle theft\")\n\n# inspect\nhead(theft_bike)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  crime_id  month reported_by falls_within longitude latitude location lsoa_code\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 62b0f525… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0916     51.5 On or n… E01000002\n2 9a078d63… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0952     51.5 On or n… E01032739\n3 f175a32e… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0872     51.5 On or n… E01032739\n4 137ec120… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0783     51.5 On or n… E01032739\n5 4c3b4677… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.108      51.5 On or n… E01032740\n6 13b5eb5c… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0980     51.5 On or n… E01032740\n# ℹ 4 more variables: lsoa_name &lt;chr&gt;, crime_type &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   last_outcome_category &lt;chr&gt;, context &lt;lgl&gt;\n\n\nNow that we have filtered the data to only include reported bicycle thefts, we need to convert our dataframe into a spatial dataframe that maps the locations of the crimes using the recorded latitude and longitude coordinates. We can then project this spatial dataframe into the British National Grid (EPSG:27700).\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to spatial data\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    filter(!is.na(longitude) & !is.na(latitude)) |&gt;\n    st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326) |&gt;\n    st_transform(27700)\n\n# inspect\nhead(theft_bike)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 531388 ymin: 180914 xmax: 533447 ymax: 181727.9\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n  crime_id           month reported_by falls_within location lsoa_code lsoa_name\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 62b0f525fc471c062… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01000002 City of …\n2 9a078d630cf67c37c… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n3 f175a32ef7f90c67a… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n4 137ec1201fd64b578… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n5 4c3b467755a98afa3… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n6 13b5eb5ca0aef09a2… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n# ℹ 4 more variables: crime_type &lt;chr&gt;, last_outcome_category &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   context &lt;lgl&gt;, geometry &lt;POINT [m]&gt;\n\n\nLet’s map the dataset to get an idea of how the data looks like, using the outline of London as background:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read spatial dataset\nmsoa21 &lt;- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n\n\nReading layer `London-MSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 1002 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n# london outline\noutline &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n  st_union()\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    size = 0.10,\n    fill = \"#fdc086\",\n    col = \"#fdc086\",\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    frame = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Reported bicycle thefts in London.\n\n\n\n\nWe can save the prepared dataset as a GeoPackage so that we can use it some other time:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# write\nst_write(theft_bike, \"data/spatial/London-BicycleTheft-2023.gpkg\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map of the world. Each map element (whether a point, line, or polygon) in OSM is tagged with various attribute data. To download the station data we need, we must use the appropriate tags, represented as key and value pairs, to query the OSM database. In our case, we are looking for train stations, which fall under the Public Transport key, with a value of station. To limit our search to London, we can use the spatial extent of the 2021 MSOA boundaries as the bounding box for data extraction.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define our bbox coordinates, use WGS84\nbbox_london &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n  st_transform(4326) |&gt;\n  st_bbox()\n\n# osm query\nosm_stations &lt;- opq(bbox = bbox_london) |&gt;\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"public_transport\", value = \"station\") |&gt;\n  osmdata_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the OSM query may return an error, particularly when multiple users from the same location are executing the exact same query. If so, you can download a prepared copy of the data here: [Download]. You can load this copy into R through load('data/spatial/London-OSM-Stations.RData')\n\n\n\nThe OSM query returns all data types, including lines and polygons tagged as stations. For our analysis, we only want to retain the point locations. In addition, we want to clip the results to the outline of London to exclude points that fall within the bounding box but outside the boundaries of Greater London.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract points\nosm_stations &lt;- osm_stations$osm_points |&gt;\n    st_set_crs(4326) |&gt;\n    st_transform(27700) |&gt;\n    st_intersection(outline) |&gt;\n    select(c(\"osm_id\", \"name\", \"network\", \"operator\", \"public_transport\", \"railway\"))\n\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_stations)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 506148.8 ymin: 168292.6 xmax: 546593.8 ymax: 191714.7\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n           osm_id                   name                      network\n780856     780856 Shepherd's Bush Market           London Underground\n1256794   1256794           West Drayton National Rail;Elizabeth line\n2013971   2013971       Finchley Central           London Underground\n9780241   9780241           St Mary Cray                National Rail\n13330343 13330343               Woodford           London Underground\n13790683 13790683               Mile End           London Underground\n                   operator public_transport railway                  geometry\n780856   London Underground          station station POINT (523195.9 180061.9)\n1256794      Elizabeth line          station station POINT (506148.8 180085.4)\n2013971  London Underground          station station   POINT (525294.7 190658)\n9780241        Southeastern          station station POINT (546593.8 168292.6)\n13330343 London Underground    stop_position    stop POINT (540946.1 191714.7)\n13790683 London Underground    stop_position    stop   POINT (536524.6 182545)\n\n# inspect\nnrow(osm_stations)\n\n[1] 4056\n\n\nThe total number of data points seems rather high.

We can use both spatial queries and geometric operations to complete this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using osmdata to retrieve train stations in London, be aware that OpenStreetMap data may be incomplete or inconsistent due to different tagging practices by contributors, missing or outdated entries, and variations in how stations are classified. While verifying every detail is beyond the scope of this practical, it is essential to exercise due diligence when working with real-world data. Where possible triangulate with other authoritative sources such as official transport datasets and at the very least perform sanity checks to identify obvious anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spatial query is used to retrieve data based on its geographic location or spatial relationships. It uses spatial information from one or more layers to find features that meet specific criteria, such as proximity, intersection, or containment. For instance, we can use a spatial query to count all the bicycle thefts that have occurred within 500 metres of a train or underground station:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create a single station geometry\nosm_stations_comb &lt;- osm_stations |&gt;\n    st_union()\n\n# spatial query\ntheft_bike$d500 &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_is_within_distance(osm_stations_comb, dist = 500, sparse = FALSE)\n\n# inspect\nhead(theft_bike)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 11 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 531388 ymin: 180914 xmax: 533447 ymax: 181727.9\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  crime_id           month reported_by falls_within location lsoa_code lsoa_name\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 62b0f525fc471c062… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01000002 City of …\n2 9a078d630cf67c37c… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n3 f175a32ef7f90c67a… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n4 137ec1201fd64b578… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n5 4c3b467755a98afa3… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n6 13b5eb5ca0aef09a2… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n# ℹ 5 more variables: crime_type &lt;chr&gt;, last_outcome_category &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   context &lt;lgl&gt;, geometry &lt;POINT [m]&gt;, d500 &lt;lgl[,1]&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code converts the stations dataframe into a single geometry. This step is essential for sf to ensure that each point in the dataset is compared to every point in the stations dataframe. Without this conversion, the comparison would be done one station point at a time, storing only the last result rather than considering all station points simultaneously.\n\n\n\nWe can use the count() function to find out just how many thefts fall in each of these categories:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# number of bicycle thefts within 500m of a station\ncount(theft_bike, d500)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 384131 ymin: 101512 xmax: 612925 ymax: 398061.1\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  d500[,1]     n                                                        geometry\n* &lt;lgl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;                                                &lt;MULTIPOINT [m]&gt;\n1 FALSE     5485 ((384131 398061.1), (409823 101512), (494953 212260), (495917 …\n2 TRUE     10534 ((505376 184282.9), (505424 184212), (505433 184416), (505558 …\n\n\nMore than two-thirds of all reported bicycle thefts in London occur within 500 metres of a train or underground station. Of course, we can map the results for a visual inspection:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# classify distances\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n  mutate(dist_class = if_else(d500 == TRUE, \"&gt; 500 m\", \"&lt; 500 m\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(dist_class = factor(dist_class, levels = c(\"&gt; 500 m\", \"&lt; 500 m\")))\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    # map data\n    col = \"dist_class\",\n    size = 0.1,\n    col.scale = tm_scale_categorical(\n      values = c(\n        \"&gt; 500 m\" = \"#fdc086\",\n        \"&lt; 500 m\" = \"#998ec3\"\n      ),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    col.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    )\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(osm_stations) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    size = 0.2,\n    fill = \"#636363\",\n    col = \"#636363\",\n  ) +\n\n  # legend\n  tm_add_legend(\n    type = \"symbols\",\n    labels = \"Station\",\n    size = 0.2,\n    fill = \"#636363\"\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.0, 0.2),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Reported bicycle thefts in London within 500 metres from a train or underground station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric operations are used to manipulate and analyse the shapes and spatial properties of geometric objects, such as points, lines, and polygons. These operations include tasks like calculating intersections, buffering, and determining the distance between shapes. In this case, we can create 500-metre buffers around each station and then count how many bicycle thefts fall within these buffers.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# buffer\nosm_stations_buffer &lt;- osm_stations |&gt;\n    st_buffer(dist = 500) |&gt;\n    st_union()\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_stations_buffer)\n\n\nGeometry set for 1 feature \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 504578.2 ymin: 158527.2 xmax: 556685.7 ymax: 200638.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((517709.6 169311.1, 517686.6 169...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen performing buffer analysis, the buffer sizes are determined by the units of the coordinate reference system (CRS) used. For instance, with the British National Grid, where the CRS is in metres, the buffer distance must be specified in metres.\n\n\n\nWe can map the results for a visual inspection:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(osm_stations_buffer) +\n\n  # specify colours\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#beaed4\",\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Train and underground stations in London with a 500 metres buffer.\n\n\n\n\nWe can now use the st_intersects function to find out which reported bicycle thefts have occurred within 500 metres of a train or underground station.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# intersect buffer with bicycle thefts\ntheft_bike$d500_buffer &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_intersects(osm_stations_buffer, sparse = FALSE)\n\n# number of bicycle thefts within 500m of a station\ncount(theft_bike, d500_buffer)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 384131 ymin: 101512 xmax: 612925 ymax: 398061.1\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  d500_buffer[,1]     n                                                 geometry\n* &lt;lgl&gt;           &lt;int&gt;                                         &lt;MULTIPOINT [m]&gt;\n1 FALSE            5491 ((384131 398061.1), (409823 101512), (494953 212260), (…\n2 TRUE            10528 ((505376 184282.9), (505424 184212), (505433 184416), (…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are almost identical, with a small difference due to how the two methods define within and handle spatial relationships and boundaries. For instance, a point on the buffer’s edge will be included in the intersect method, but may not meet the distance threshold required by st_within_distance().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we are familiar with basic spatial queries and geometric operations, we can conduct a similar analysis on the number of serious and fatal road crashed in London in 2022 and determine how many occurred on or near a main road. Try to do the following:\n\nDownload the two datasets provided below and save them in the appropriate subfolder within your data directory. The datasets include:\n\nA csv file containing the number of road crashes that occurred in London in 2022, extracted from the UK’s official road traffic casualty database using the stats19 R library.\nA GeoPackage file that contains main roads in London, extracted from the Ordnance Survey Open Roads dataset.\n\nCalculate the number of serious and fatal road crashes that occurred within 100 metres and 500 metres of a main road.\n\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon STATS19 Road Collisions 2022\ncsv\nDownload\n\n\nLondon OS Open Roads - Main Roads\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoom. That is how you can conduct basic spatial queries and geometric operations and using R and sf. Yet more RGIS coming over the next couple of weeks, but this concludes the tutorial for this week.

    "text": "This week, we will examine to what extent reported bicycle theft in London cluster around train and underground stations. We will be using open data from data.police.uk on reported crimes alongside OpenStreetMap data for this analysis. We will use R to directly download the necessary data from OpenStreetMap, but the crime data will need to be manually downloaded from the data portal. We further have access to a GeoPackage that contains the London 2021 MSOA boundaries that we can use as reference layer. If you do not already have it on your computer, save this file in your data/spatial folder.\n\n\n\nFile\nType\nLink\n\n\n\n\nLondon MSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries\nGeoPackage\nDownload\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK Police Data Portal allows you to access and generate tabular data for crime recorded in the UK across the different police forces. To download recorded crime data for London:\n\nNavigate to data.police.uk and click on Downloads.\nUnder the data range select January 2023 to December 2023.\nUnder the Custom download tab select Metropolitan Police Service and City of London Police. Leave the other settings unchanged and click on Generate file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Downloading data on reported crimes through data.police.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may take a few minutes for the download to be generated, so be patient. Once the Download now button appears, you can download the dataset.\nAfter downloading, unzip the file. You will find that the zip file contains 12 folders, one for each month of 2023. Each folder includes two files: one for the Metropolitan Police Service and one for the City of London Police.\nCreate a new folder named London-Crime within your data/attributes directory, and copy all 12 folders with the data into this new folder.\n\nTo get started, let us create our first script. File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. Save your script as w02-bike-theft.r.\nWe will start by loading the libraries that we will need:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(osmdata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have to install some of these libraries if you have not used these before.\n\n\n\nAlthough we could read each individual crime file into R one by one and then combine them, we can actually accomplish this in a single step:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# list all csv files\ncrime_df &lt;- list.files(path = \"data/attributes/London-Crime/\", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE) |&gt;\n  # read individual csv files\n  lapply(read_csv) |&gt;\n  # bind together into one\n  bind_rows()\n\n# inspect\nhead(crime_df)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  `Crime ID`      Month `Reported by` `Falls within` Longitude Latitude Location\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 4a14d4745da0a2… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.106     51.5 On or n…\n2 e6e32581c99c5b… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.107     51.5 On or n…\n3 7b7cb8e7debe8b… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.110     51.5 On or n…\n4 f7fc44e1e76332… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.108     51.5 On or n…\n5 8083dafd1770af… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.112     51.5 On or n…\n6 4587239a45f0e8… 2023… City of Lond… City of Londo…    -0.112     51.5 On or n…\n# ℹ 5 more variables: `LSOA code` &lt;chr&gt;, `LSOA name` &lt;chr&gt;, `Crime type` &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   `Last outcome category` &lt;chr&gt;, Context &lt;lgl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your computer, processing this data may take some time due to the large volume involved. Once completed, you should have a dataframe containing 1,144,329 observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can further inspect the object using the View() function.\n\n\n\nThe column names contain spaces and are therefore not easily referenced. We can easily clean this up using the janitor package:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# clean names\ncrime_df &lt;- crime_df |&gt;\n    clean_names()\n\n# inspect\nnames(crime_df)\n\n\n [1] \"crime_id\"              \"month\"                 \"reported_by\"          \n [4] \"falls_within\"          \"longitude\"             \"latitude\"             \n [7] \"location\"              \"lsoa_code\"             \"lsoa_name\"            \n[10] \"crime_type\"            \"last_outcome_category\" \"context\"              \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your clean_names() function returns an error, it is likely due to a conflict with another library that also includes a clean_names() function. In such cases, R cannot determine which one to use. To resolve this, you can specify the library explicitly by using janitor::clean_names().\n\n\n\nFor our analysis, we are currently only interested in reported bicycle thefts, so we need to filter our data based on the crime_type column. We can start by examining the unique values in this column and then subset the data accordingly:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# unique types\nunique(crime_df$crime_type)\n\n\n [1] \"Other theft\"                  \"Other crime\"                 \n [3] \"Theft from the person\"        \"Public order\"                \n [5] \"Anti-social behaviour\"        \"Burglary\"                    \n [7] \"Criminal damage and arson\"    \"Drugs\"                       \n [9] \"Shoplifting\"                  \"Vehicle crime\"               \n[11] \"Violence and sexual offences\" \"Bicycle theft\"               \n[13] \"Robbery\"                      \"Possession of weapons\"       \n\n# filter\ntheft_bike &lt;- crime_df |&gt;\n    filter(crime_type == \"Bicycle theft\")\n\n# inspect\nhead(theft_bike)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  crime_id  month reported_by falls_within longitude latitude location lsoa_code\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 62b0f525… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0916     51.5 On or n… E01000002\n2 9a078d63… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0952     51.5 On or n… E01032739\n3 f175a32e… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0872     51.5 On or n… E01032739\n4 137ec120… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0783     51.5 On or n… E01032739\n5 4c3b4677… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.108      51.5 On or n… E01032740\n6 13b5eb5c… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon…   -0.0980     51.5 On or n… E01032740\n# ℹ 4 more variables: lsoa_name &lt;chr&gt;, crime_type &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   last_outcome_category &lt;chr&gt;, context &lt;lgl&gt;\n\n\nNow that we have filtered the data to only include reported bicycle thefts, we need to convert our dataframe into a spatial dataframe that maps the locations of the crimes using the recorded latitude and longitude coordinates. We can then project this spatial dataframe into the British National Grid (EPSG:27700).\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# to spatial data\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    filter(!is.na(longitude) & !is.na(latitude)) |&gt;\n    st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"), crs = 4326) |&gt;\n    st_transform(27700)\n\n# inspect\nhead(theft_bike)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 531388 ymin: 180914 xmax: 533447 ymax: 181727.9\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n  crime_id           month reported_by falls_within location lsoa_code lsoa_name\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 62b0f525fc471c062… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01000002 City of …\n2 9a078d630cf67c37c… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n3 f175a32ef7f90c67a… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n4 137ec1201fd64b578… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n5 4c3b467755a98afa3… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n6 13b5eb5ca0aef09a2… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n# ℹ 4 more variables: crime_type &lt;chr&gt;, last_outcome_category &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   context &lt;lgl&gt;, geometry &lt;POINT [m]&gt;\n\n\nLet’s map the dataset to get an idea of how the data looks like, using the outline of London as background:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# read spatial dataset\nmsoa21 &lt;- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n\n\nReading layer `London-MSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 1002 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n# london outline\noutline &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n  st_union()\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    size = 0.10,\n    fill = \"#fdc086\",\n    col = \"#fdc086\",\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    frame = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Reported bicycle thefts in London.\n\n\n\n\nWe can save the prepared dataset as a GeoPackage so that we can use it some other time:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# write\nst_write(theft_bike, \"data/spatial/London-BicycleTheft-2023.gpkg\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, editable map of the world. Each map element (whether a point, line, or polygon) in OSM is tagged with various attribute data. To download the station data we need, we must use the appropriate tags, represented as key and value pairs, to query the OSM database. In our case, we are looking for train stations, which fall under the Public Transport key, with a value of station. To limit our search to London, we can use the spatial extent of the 2021 MSOA boundaries as the bounding box for data extraction.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# define our bbox coordinates, use WGS84\nbbox_london &lt;- msoa21 |&gt;\n  st_transform(4326) |&gt;\n  st_bbox()\n\n# osm query\nosm_stations &lt;- opq(bbox = bbox_london) |&gt;\n  add_osm_feature(key = \"public_transport\", value = \"station\") |&gt;\n  osmdata_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the OSM query may return an error, particularly when multiple users from the same location are executing the exact same query. If so, you can download a prepared copy of the data here: [Download]. You can load this copy into R through load('data/spatial/London-OSM-Stations.RData')\n\n\n\nThe OSM query returns all data types, including lines and polygons tagged as stations. For our analysis, we only want to retain the point locations. In addition, we want to clip the results to the outline of London to exclude points that fall within the bounding box but outside the boundaries of Greater London.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# extract points\nosm_stations &lt;- osm_stations$osm_points |&gt;\n    st_set_crs(4326) |&gt;\n    st_transform(27700) |&gt;\n    st_intersection(outline) |&gt;\n    select(c(\"osm_id\", \"name\", \"network\", \"operator\", \"public_transport\", \"railway\"))\n\n\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_stations)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 6 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 506148.8 ymin: 168292.6 xmax: 546593.8 ymax: 191714.7\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n           osm_id                   name                      network\n780856     780856 Shepherd's Bush Market           London Underground\n1256794   1256794           West Drayton National Rail;Elizabeth line\n2013971   2013971       Finchley Central           London Underground\n9780241   9780241           St Mary Cray                National Rail\n13330343 13330343               Woodford           London Underground\n13790683 13790683               Mile End           London Underground\n                   operator public_transport railway                  geometry\n780856   London Underground          station station POINT (523195.9 180061.9)\n1256794      Elizabeth line          station station POINT (506148.8 180085.4)\n2013971  London Underground          station station   POINT (525294.7 190658)\n9780241        Southeastern          station station POINT (546593.8 168292.6)\n13330343 London Underground    stop_position    stop POINT (540946.1 191714.7)\n13790683 London Underground    stop_position    stop   POINT (536524.6 182545)\n\n# inspect\nnrow(osm_stations)\n\n[1] 4056\n\n\nThe total number of data points seems rather high.

We can use both spatial queries and geometric operations to complete this analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using osmdata to retrieve train stations in London, be aware that OpenStreetMap data may be incomplete or inconsistent due to different tagging practices by contributors, missing or outdated entries, and variations in how stations are classified. While verifying every detail is beyond the scope of this practical, it is essential to exercise due diligence when working with real-world data. Where possible triangulate with other authoritative sources such as official transport datasets and at the very least perform sanity checks to identify obvious anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA spatial query is used to retrieve data based on its geographic location or spatial relationships. It uses spatial information from one or more layers to find features that meet specific criteria, such as proximity, intersection, or containment. For instance, we can use a spatial query to count all the bicycle thefts that have occurred within 500 metres of a train or underground station:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# create a single station geometry\nosm_stations_comb &lt;- osm_stations |&gt;\n    st_union()\n\n# spatial query\ntheft_bike$d500 &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_is_within_distance(osm_stations_comb, dist = 500, sparse = FALSE)\n\n# inspect\nhead(theft_bike)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 11 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 531388 ymin: 180914 xmax: 533447 ymax: 181727.9\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n  crime_id           month reported_by falls_within location lsoa_code lsoa_name\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 62b0f525fc471c062… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01000002 City of …\n2 9a078d630cf67c37c… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n3 f175a32ef7f90c67a… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n4 137ec1201fd64b578… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032739 City of …\n5 4c3b467755a98afa3… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n6 13b5eb5ca0aef09a2… 2023… City of Lo… City of Lon… On or n… E01032740 City of …\n# ℹ 5 more variables: crime_type &lt;chr&gt;, last_outcome_category &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   context &lt;lgl&gt;, geometry &lt;POINT [m]&gt;, d500 &lt;lgl[,1]&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above code converts the stations dataframe into a single geometry. This step is essential for sf to ensure that each point in the dataset is compared to every point in the stations dataframe. Without this conversion, the comparison would be done one station point at a time, storing only the last result rather than considering all station points simultaneously.\n\n\n\nWe can use the count() function to find out just how many thefts fall in each of these categories:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# number of bicycle thefts within 500m of a station\ncount(theft_bike, d500)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 384131 ymin: 101512 xmax: 612925 ymax: 398061.1\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  d500[,1]     n                                                        geometry\n* &lt;lgl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;                                                &lt;MULTIPOINT [m]&gt;\n1 FALSE     5485 ((384131 398061.1), (409823 101512), (494953 212260), (495917 …\n2 TRUE     10534 ((505376 184282.9), (505424 184212), (505433 184416), (505558 …\n\n\nMore than two-thirds of all reported bicycle thefts in London occur within 500 metres of a train or underground station. Of course, we can map the results for a visual inspection:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# classify distances\ntheft_bike &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n  mutate(dist_class = if_else(d500 == TRUE, \"&gt; 500 m\", \"&lt; 500 m\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(dist_class = factor(dist_class, levels = c(\"&gt; 500 m\", \"&lt; 500 m\")))\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(theft_bike) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    # map data\n    col = \"dist_class\",\n    size = 0.1,\n    col.scale = tm_scale_categorical(\n      values = c(\n        \"&gt; 500 m\" = \"#fdc086\",\n        \"&lt; 500 m\" = \"#998ec3\"\n      ),\n    ),\n\n    # legend\n    col.legend = tm_legend(\n      title = \"\",\n      frame = FALSE,\n    )\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(osm_stations) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_symbols(\n    size = 0.2,\n    fill = \"#636363\",\n    col = \"#636363\",\n  ) +\n\n  # legend\n  tm_add_legend(\n    type = \"symbols\",\n    labels = \"Station\",\n    size = 0.2,\n    fill = \"#636363\"\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # legend\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(0.0, 0.2),\n    legend.text.size = 0.8,\n\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Reported bicycle thefts in London within 500 metres from a train or underground station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric operations are used to manipulate and analyse the shapes and spatial properties of geometric objects, such as points, lines, and polygons. These operations include tasks like calculating intersections, buffering, and determining the distance between shapes. In this case, we can create 500-metre buffers around each station and then count how many bicycle thefts fall within these buffers.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# buffer\nosm_stations_buffer &lt;- osm_stations |&gt;\n    st_buffer(dist = 500) |&gt;\n    st_union()\n\n# inspect\nhead(osm_stations_buffer)\n\n\nGeometry set for 1 feature \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 504578.2 ymin: 158527.2 xmax: 556685.7 ymax: 200638.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON (((517709.6 169311.1, 517686.6 169...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen performing buffer analysis, the buffer sizes are determined by the units of the coordinate reference system (CRS) used. For instance, with the British National Grid, where the CRS is in metres, the buffer distance must be specified in metres.\n\n\n\nWe can map the results for a visual inspection:\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# shape\ntm_shape(outline) +\n\n  # map data\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#f0f0f0\",\n    col = NA\n  ) +\n\n  # shape\n  tm_shape(osm_stations_buffer) +\n\n  # specify colours\n  tm_polygons(\n    fill = \"#beaed4\",\n  ) +\n\n  # layout\n  tm_layout(\n    # canvas\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Train and underground stations in London with a 500 metres buffer.\n\n\n\n\nWe can now use the st_intersects function to find out which reported bicycle thefts have occurred within 500 metres of a train or underground station.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# intersect buffer with bicycle thefts\ntheft_bike$d500_buffer &lt;- theft_bike |&gt;\n    st_intersects(osm_stations_buffer, sparse = FALSE)\n\n# number of bicycle thefts within 500m of a station\ncount(theft_bike, d500_buffer)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 384131 ymin: 101512 xmax: 612925 ymax: 398061.1\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  d500_buffer[,1]     n                                                 geometry\n* &lt;lgl&gt;           &lt;int&gt;                                         &lt;MULTIPOINT [m]&gt;\n1 FALSE            5491 ((384131 398061.1), (409823 101512), (494953 212260), (…\n2 TRUE            10528 ((505376 184282.9), (505424 184212), (505433 184416), (…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are almost identical, with a small difference due to how the two methods define within and handle spatial relationships and boundaries.
