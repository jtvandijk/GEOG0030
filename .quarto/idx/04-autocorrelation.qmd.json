{"title":"Spatial Autocorrelation","markdown":{"headingText":"Spatial Autocorrelation","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"This week, we will explore the concept of spatial dependenceâ€”the idea that the value of a variable at one location is influenced by the value of the same variable at nearby locations. This dependence can be statistically measured by assessing spatial autocorrelation, which refers to the degree of similarity between values of a variable at different locations or between multiple variables at the same location.\n\n## Lecture slides {#lecture-w04}\nYou can download the slides of this week's lecture here: [[Link]]({{< var slides.week04 >}}).\n\n## Reading list {#reading-w04}\n#### Essential readings {.unnumbered}\n- Griffith, D. 2017. *Spatial Autocorrelation*.

The data covers all usual residents, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the [Lower Super Output Area (LSOA)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeographies/census2021geographies) level. The data has been extracted using the [Custom Dataset Tool](https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/create) and subsequently processed to include only the proportion of individuals who self-identify as belonging to one of the Asian categories. Along with this dataset, we also have access to a `GeoPackage` that contains the LSOA boundaries. You can download both files below and save them in your project folder under `data/attributes` and `data/spatial`, respectively.\n\n| File                                        | Type   | Link |\n|

tidy: True\n#| filename: 'R code'\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(spdep)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nYou may have to install some of these libraries if you have not used these before.\n:::\n\nOnce downloaded, we can load both files into memory:\n```{r}\n#| label: 04-load-gpkg-csv\n#| classes: styled-output\n#| echo: True\n#| eval: True\n#| tidy: True\n#| filename: \"R code\"\n# read spatial dataset\nlsoa21 <- st_read('data/spatial/London-LSOA-2021.gpkg')\n\n# load ethnicity data\nlsoa_eth <- read_csv('data/attributes/London-LSOA-Asian.csv')\n``` \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou can inspect both objects using the `View()` function. \n:::\n\n### Spatial dependency\nAs you should know by now, the first step when working with spatial data is to create a
