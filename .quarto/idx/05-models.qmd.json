{"title":"Spatial Models","markdown":{"headingText":"Spatial Models","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"Last week, we explored spatial dependency and methods for measuring it. This week, we will examine how spatial autocorrelation can impact our analyses, especially in models where independence assumptions are crucial. To address these dependencies, we will use the `GWmodel` library to calculate local summary statistics for geographical areas and to fit basic spatially explicit models to our data.\n\n## Lecture slides \nYou can download the slides of this week's lecture here: [[Link]]({{< var slides.week05 >}}).\n\n## Reading list\n#### Essential readings {.unnumbered}\n- Harris, R. 2019. **Chapter 8**: *Not just nuisance: Spatialising social statistics.* In: Whitworth, A.

You will work with data extracted from two data sources: the [constituency results from the election](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10009/) and socio-demographic information relating to age groups, economic status, and ethnic background from the 2021 Census, extracted using the [Custom Dataset Tool](https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/create). These datasets have been prepared and merged. Along with this dataset, we also have access to a `GeoPackage` that contains the boundaries of the parliamentary constituencies. \n\nYou can download both files below and save them in your project folder under `data/attributes` and `data/spatial`, respectively.\n\n| File                                                        | Type   | Link |\n| :------
