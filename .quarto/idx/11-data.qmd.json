Accessing these datasets requires following a specific process, which is outlined on the CDRC website. When applying, you will need to explain why you require the specific dataset and describe how you intend to use it. Additionally, consider the ethical implications of using the data, as this will be an important part of your application. Please be aware that it normally takes 4-5 weeks for your application to be processed.\n\nSome of the datasets held by the CDRC that you can apply for are: \n\n- [Bicycle Sharing System Docking Station Observations](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/bicycle-sharing-system-docking-station-observations)\n- [CDRC Modelled Ethnicity Proportions - LSOA Geography]( https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/cdrc-modelled-ethnicity-proportions-lsoa-geography)\n- [FCA Financial Lives Survey](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/fca-financial-lives-survey)\n- [Speedchecker Broadband Internet Speed Tests](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/speedchecker-broadband-internet-speed-tests)\n\n::: { .callout-tip}\nSince the application process for Safeguarded CDRC datasets can take several weeks, these datasets may be more suitable for your undergraduate dissertation rather than the GEOG0030 coursework assignment. However, CDRC datasets labeled as **Open Data** do not require an application process. You can download these datasets directly after registering on the website.\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":false,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["assets/styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":4,"highlight-style":"atom-one","number-sections":true,"output-file":"11-data.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
