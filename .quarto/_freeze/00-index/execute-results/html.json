This module offers a deep dive into the principles of spatial analysis while providing a thorough introduction to programming. Over the next ten weeks, you will explore the theory, methods, and tools of spatial analysis through engaging case studies. You will gain hands-on experience in sourcing, managing, and cleaning spatial, demographic, and socioeconomic datasets, and apply core spatial analysis techniques to interpret them.\n\n## Moodle {.unnumbered}\n[Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/) serves as the central hub for GEOG0030, where you will find all essential module information, including key details about assessments. This workbook provides links to all required reading materials and contains the content for each computer tutorial.\n\n## Module overview {.unnumbered}\nThe topics covered over the next ten weeks are:\n\n| Week | Section  | Topic |\n| :--- |:---------|:------------------ |\n| 1    | Foundational Concepts | [Programming for Spatial Analysis]({{< var urls.w01 >}}) |\n| 2    | Foundational Concepts | [Analysing Point Data]({{< var urls.w02 >}}) | \n| 3    | Foundational Concepts | [Spatial Queries and Geometric Operations]({{< var urls.w03 >}}) | \n| 4    | Foundational Concepts | [Spatial Autocorrelation]({{< var urls.w04 >}}) |\n| 5    | Foundational Concepts | [Spatial Models]({{< var urls.w05 >}}) |\n|      | **Reading week** | **Reading week** |\n| 6    | Applied Spatial Analysis | [Raster Models]({{< var urls.w06 >}})|\n| 7    | Applied Spatial Analysis | [Geodemographics]({{< var urls.w07 >}})|\n| 8    | Applied Spatial Analysis | [Transport Network Analysis]({{< var urls.w08 >}}) |\n| 9    | Data Visualisation | [Complex Visualisations]({{< var urls.w09 >}}) | \n| 10   | Data Visualisation | [Beyond the Choropleth]({{< var urls.w10 >}}) | \n\n## Troubleshooting {.unnumbered}\nSpatial analysis can provide valuable insights into geographical relationships, though it can be challenging, especially when combined with learning to programme. You may encounter error messages, software crashes, and spend time identifying bugs in your code. However, the skills you gain in solving complex spatial problems through programming will be well worth the effort.\n\nFor specific assistance with this module, you can:\n\n- Ask a question at the end of lectures or during computer practicals.\n- Refer to the [Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/) assessment tab for queries about module assessments.\n- Attend the scheduled Geocomputation **Additional Support Hours**.\n- Book a slot during our [Academic Support and Feedback hours](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/8561a481703d4feda7a704ab81b62c8d@ucl.ac.uk?anonymous&ep=plink). \n\n## Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}\nThis year's workbook is compiled using:\n\n- The [GEOG0030: Geocomputation 2023-2024](https://jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030_20232024/) workbook by [Justin van Dijk](https://www.mappingdutchman.com)\n- The [GEOG0030: Geocomputation 2022-2023](https://jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030_20222023/) workbook by [Justin van Dijk](https://www.mappingdutchman.com)\n- The [GEOG0030: Geocomputation 2021-2022](https://jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030_20212022/) workbook by [Justin van Dijk](https://www.mappingdutchman.com)\n- The [GEOG0030: Geocomputation 2020-2021](https://jo-wilkin.github.io/GEOG0030/coursebook/index.html) workbook by [Jo Wilkin](https://github.com/jo-wilkin)\n\nThis year's workbook also takes inspiration and design elements from:\n\n- The [Spatial Data Science for Social Geography](https://martinfleischmann.net/sds/) course by [Martin Fleischmann](https://martinfleischmann.net/)\n- The [Mapping and Modelling Geographic Data in R](https://profrichharris.github.io/MandM/) course by [Richard Harris](https://profrichharris.github.io/)\n\n## Major updates {.unnumbered}\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis year's version features the following **major** updates:\n\n- Second full rewrite of the workbook using `Quarto`.\n- Improved alignment with [GEOG0018 Methods in Human Geography](https://jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030).\n- New material on geocoding, spatial models, geodemographic classification, and data visualisation.\n- Introduction of package management using `renv`.\n:::",
