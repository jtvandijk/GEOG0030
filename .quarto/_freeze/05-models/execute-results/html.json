This week, we will examine how spatial autocorrelation can impact our analyses, especially in models where independence assumptions are crucial. To address these dependencies, we will use the `GWmodel` library to calculate local summary statistics for geographical areas and to fit basic spatially explicit models to our data.\n\n## Lecture slides \nYou can download the slides of this week's lecture here: [[Link]]({{< var slides.week05 >}}).\n\n## Reading list\n#### Essential readings {.unnumbered}\n- Harris, R. 2019. **Chapter 8**: *Not just nuisance: Spatialising social statistics.* In: Whitworth, A.

You will work with data extracted from two data sources: the [constituency results from the election](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10009/) and socio-demographic information relating to age groups, economic status, and ethnic background from the 2021 Census, extracted using the [Custom Dataset Tool](https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/create). These datasets have been prepared and merged. Along with this dataset, we also have access to a `GeoPackage` that contains the boundaries of the parliamentary constituencies. \n\nYou can download both files below and save them in your project

dataset and we hypothesised that predominantly older voters tend to support the Conservative Party. To explore this, we examined the relationship between the proportion of individuals over 50 years old in each parliamentary constituency (`aged_50_years_and_over`) and the proportion of votes cast for the Conservative Party (`conservative_vote_share`). A scatterplot and Pearson's correlation revealed a moderate association between the two variables, suggesting a possible link between age demographics and Conservative voting patterns:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# correlation\ncor.test(elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over, elec_24$conservative_vote_share, method = \"pearson\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tPearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over and elec_24$conservative_vote_share\nt = 16.472, df = 573, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.5086971 0.6199173\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.5668849 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# scatterplot\nplot(elec_24$aged_50_years_and_over, elec_24$conservative_vote_share, xlab = \"Proportion of population over 50 years old\",\n    ylab = \"Proportion of votes for the Conservative party\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Quick scatterplot](05-models_files/figure-html/fig-05-plot-data-scatter-1.png){#fig-05-plot-data-scatter width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, as you should know by now, the first step when working with spatial data is to map your variables:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# join attribute data onto spatial data\ncons_24 <- cons_24 |>\n  left_join(elec_24, by = c(\"pcon24cd\" = \"constituency_code\"))\n\n# shape, polygons\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # specify column, colours\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"conservative_vote_share\",\n    style = \"jenks\",\n    n = \"5\",\n    palette = c(\"#f1eef6\", \"#bdc9e1\", \"#74a9cf\", \"#2b8cbe\", \"#045a8d\"),\n    title = \"Conservative vote share\"\n  ) +\n\n  # set layout\n  tm_layout(\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(\"left\", \"top\"),\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proportions of votes cast for the Conservative party in the 2024 elections.](05-models_files/figure-html/fig-05-map-vote-share-1.png){#fig-05-map-vote-share width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# shape, polygons\ntm_shape(cons_24) +\n\n  # specify column, colours\n  tm_fill(\n    col = \"aged_50_years_and_over\",\n    style = \"jenks\",\n    n = \"5\",\n    palette = c(\"#f0f0f0\", \"#d9d9d9\", \"#bdbdbd\", \"#969696\", \"#737373\"),\n    title = \"50+ population share\"\n  ) +\n\n  # set layout\n  tm_layout(\n    legend.outside = FALSE,\n    legend.position = c(\"left\", \"top\"),\n    frame = FALSE\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proportions of population over 50 years old.](05-models_files/figure-html/fig-05-map-over-50-share-1.png){#fig-05-map-over-50-share width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the maps, the spatial distribution of Conservative vote share and the proportion of the population over 50 appears neither random nor uniform. This raises the question to what extent the observed correlation in @fig-05-plot-data-scatter holds consistently across different constituencies? To answer this we can run a Geographically Weighted Correlation using the `GWmodel` library.\n\nGeographically Weighted Correlation (GWC) allows us to investigate whether the strength and direction of the association between variables vary across space. By applying a localised correlation technique, GWC calculates the correlation coefficient within specified spatial windows or *kernels* across the study area. This can reveal geographic areas where the relationship is stronger or weaker, providing more insight than a single global correlation and helping us to understand spatial heterogeneity in the data.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe `GWmodel` library allows us to calculate local statistics, such as means, standard deviations, variances, and correlations. But [as with spatial autocorrelation](04-autocorrelation.html#defining-neighbours), we must define what *local* means. One approach is to use a kernel function to select which values contribute to each local estimate. Kernels operate on point locations (e.g. polygon centroids) and apply a window with a specified shape and bandwidth. The bandwidth, which defines the kernel's size, can be set in absolute terms (e.g. within 10 km) or in relative terms (e.g. the 10 nearest centroids), the latter known as an adaptive kernel.\n:::\n\nThe `GWmodel` library uses the older `sp` data format for handling spatial data. We therefore need to convert our current `sf` object to `sp` before continuing:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# to sp\ncons_24_sp <- as_Spatial(cons_24)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe `sf` package is now preferred over `sp` in R for its modern, efficient handling of spatial data. By using simple features, a standardised format for spatial geometries, `sf` is more compatible with other geospatial tools and integrates smoothly with the tidyverse, simplifying data manipulation and analysis. However, some libraries still rely on `sp` and have not yet transitioned to `sf.`\n:::\n\nWe can now calculate a geographically weighted correlation. We will use an adaptive bandwidth that estimates the local correlation using the 25 nearest constituencies:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# geographically weighted correlation\ncons_24_cor <- gwss(cons_24_sp, vars = c(\"conservative_vote_share\", \"aged_50_years_and_over\"),\n    bw = 25, adaptive = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now extract the values and bind these back to our original `sf` object:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# extract correlation\ncons_24 <- cons_24 |>\n    mutate(cons_age_cor = cons_24_cor$SDF$Corr_conservative_vote_share.aged_50_years_and_over)\n\n# inspect\nsummary(cons_24$cons_age_cor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    Min.  1st Qu.

Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is used when the relationship between a dependent and set of independent variables is not constant across space, meaning the model coefficients vary by location. This is useful when you suspect that the relationship between variables may change depending on the geographic context. GWR provides a localised understanding of the relationships by allowing each observation to have its own set of regression coefficients, which can provide insights into how relationships differ across the study area. \n\nGWR fits a separate regression equation at each location in the study area, weighting nearby observations more heavily than those farther away. Again, the weighting is typically based on a kernel function. The basic GWR equation is:\n\n$$\ny_{i} = \\beta_{0}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i}) + \\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\beta_{k}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})x_{ik} + \\epsilon_{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})$ are the coordinates of location $i$ and $\\beta_{k}(\\upsilon_{i}, v_{i})$ are the location-specific coefficients. \n\n#### Multivariate regression\nTo predict the Conservative voter share, we hypothesise that certain socio-demographic variables may play a significant role.

However, whilst out of the scope of this module, there are many other approaches to account for space in statistical models. Examples of such models are the spatial error model and the spatial lag model.\n\n#### Spatial error model\nThe spatial error model is used when the error terms in a regression model exhibit spatial autocorrelation, meaning the error terms are not independent across space. This can happen due to omitted variables that have a spatial pattern or unmeasured factors that affect the dependent variable similarly across nearby locations.\n\nThe model adjusts for spatial autocorrelation by adding a spatially lagged error term (a weighted sum of the errors from neighbouring locations) to the regression equation:\n\n$$\ny = X\\beta + \\upsilon, \\upsilon = \\lambda W \\upsilon + \\epsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $X\\beta$ represents the standard regression components, $\\lambda$ is a spatial autoregressive parameter, $W$ is a spatial weights matrix, and $\\upsilon$ is a vector of spatially autocorrelated errors.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSpatial error models can be fitted using R's [spatialreg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatialreg/index.html) package.\n:::\n\n#### Spatial lag model\nThe spatial lag model is appropriate when the dependent variable itself exhibits spatial dependence. This means the value of the dependent variable in one location depends on the values in neighbouring locations. This model is used to capture the spillover effects or diffusion processes, where the outcome in one area is influenced by outcomes in nearby areas (e.g. house prices, crime rates).\n\nThe model incorporates a spatially lagged dependent variable, which is the weighted sum of the dependent variable values in neighbouring locations, into the regression equation:\n\n$$\ny = \\rho Wy + X\\beta + \\epsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the spatial autoregressive coefficient, $Wy$ represents the spatially lagged dependent variable, and $X\\beta$ represents the standard regression components.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nSpatial lag models can be fitted using R's [spatialreg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatialreg/index.html) package.\n:::\n\n#### To note\nThe spatial error model adjusts for spatial autocorrelation in the error terms, whereas the spatial lag model adjusts for spatial dependence in the dependent variable itself. The spatial error model does not alter the interpretation of the coefficients of the independent variables, while the spatial lag model introduces a feedback loop where changes in one area can influence neighbouring areas.\n\nBoth the spatial error and spatial lag models assume that the relationships between variables are the same across the study area, with adjustments made only for spatial dependencies. GWR, on the other hand, allows the relationships themselves to vary across space. GWR is more flexible but also more complex and computationally intensive, providing local instead of global estimates of coefficients.\n\n## Assignment\nThe Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) reveals some varying patterns in the sign and directiion of the Conservative voter share, but it is likely that other factors are at play. One could hypothesise that another potential predictor of the Conservative vote share is the proportion of the population employed in a particular industry. Try to do the following:\n\n1. Download the dataset provided below and save it to the appropriate subfolder within your `data` directory. The `csv`, extracted using the [Custom Dataset Tool](https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/create), contains the number of employed individuals as recorded in the 2021 Census by their [Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/census2021dictionary/variablesbytopic/labourmarketvariablescensus2021/industrycurrent#:~:text=Type%3A%20Derived%20variable-,Definition,firm%20or%20organisation's%20main%20activity.) code.\n2. Formulate a hypothesis regarding which of the nine main industries presented in the dataset might help predict the Conservative vote share.\n3. For the chosen industry variable:\n    * Calculate the share of individuals employed in that industry.\n    * [Extend the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)](05-models.html#geographically-weighted-regression-1) by including this new variable.\n4.

Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is particularly useful when the relationship between variables varies across space, as it allows for localised regression coefficients and helps identify spatial heterogeneity that might be overlooked in global models.
