We can organise these scripts into [RStudio projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects), which consolidate all files related to an analysis such as input data, R scripts, results, figures, and more. This organisation helps keep track of all data, input, and output, while enabling us to create standalone scripts for each part of our analysis. Additionally, it simplifies managing [directories and filepaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)) and allows us to keep track of our installed packages through [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nPackage management in R involves handling the installation, updating, and tracking of external libraries needed for your code. This ensures that your R scripts can run smoothly without issues related to missing or incompatible packages. Within an RStudio project, you can use `renv` to create a reproducible environment by capturing the specific package versions used in the project. This means that anyone working on or revisiting the project will have access to the same package setup, preventing problems caused by package updates or changes. \n:::\n\nNavigate to **File** -> **New Project** -> **New Directory**. Choose a directory name, such as `GEOG0030`, and select the location on your computer where you want to save this project by clicking on **Browse...**. \n\n::: {.callout-important}\nEnsure you select an appropriate folder to store your `GEOG0030` project. For example, you might use your *Geocomputation* folder, if you have one, or another location within your `Documents` directory on your computer.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nPlease ensure that **folder names** and **file names** do not contain spaces or special characters such as `*` `.` `\"` `/` `\\` `[` `]` `:` `;` `|` `=` `,` `<` `?` `>` `&` `$` `#` `!` `'` `{` `}` `(` `)`. Different operating systems and programming languages deal differently with spaces and special characters and as such including these in your folder names and file names can cause many problems and unexpected errors. As an alternative to using white space you can use an underscore (`_`) or hyphen (`-`) if you like.\n:::\n\nTick the checkbox for *Use renv with this project* and click on **Create Project**. You should now see your main RStudio window switch to this new project and when you check your **files** pane, you should see a new **R Project** called `GEOG0030`.\n\nWith our `GEOG0030` project ready to go, in this first tutorial we will look at the distribution of the share of European immigrants across London. The data covers the number of people residing in London that are born in a European country, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the [Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeographies/census2021geographies) level.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nAn MSOA is a geographic unit used in the UK for statistical analysis. It typically represents small areas with populations of around 5,000 to 15,000 people and is designed to ensure consistent data reporting. MSOAs are commonly used to report on census data, deprivation indices, and other socio-economic statistics.\n:::\n\nThe dataset has been extracted using the [Custom Dataset Tool](https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/create), and you can download the file via the link provided below. Save the file in your project folder under `data/attributes`. Along with this dataset, we also have access to a `GeoPackage` that contains the MSOA boundaries. Save this file under `data/spatial`, respectively.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou will to have create a folder named `data` within your RStudio Project directory, inside which you will have to have a folder named `attributes` and a folder named `spatial`.\n:::\n\n| File                                        | Type   | Link |\n| :------                                     | :------| :------ |\n| London MSOA Census 2021 European Population | `csv` | [Download](https://github.com/jtvandijk/GEOG0030/tree/master/data/attributes/London-MSOA-European.csv) |\n| London MSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries         | `GeoPackage` | [Download](https://github.com/jtvandijk/GEOG0030/raw/refs/heads/main/data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg) |\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nTo download a `csv` file that is hosted on GitHub, click on the **Download raw file** button on the top right of your screen and it should download directly to your computer.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou may have used spatial data before and noticed that we did not download a collection of files known as a `shapefile` but a `GeoPackage` instead. Whilst `shapefiles` are still being used, `GeoPackage` is a more modern and portable file format. Have a look at this article on *towardsdatascience.com* for an excellent explanation on why one should use `GeoPackage` files over `shapefiles` where possible: [[Link]](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-need-to-use-geopackage-files-instead-of-shapefile-or-geojson-7cb24fe56416)\n:::\n\nTo get started, let us create our first script. **File** -> **New File** -> **R Script**. Save your script as `w01-european-population-london.r`. \n\nWe will start by loading the libraries that we will need:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nYou may have to install some of these libraries if you have not used these before.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nFor Linux and macOS users who are new to working with spatial data in R, the installation of the `sf` library may fail because additional (non-R) libraries are required which are automatically installed for Windows users. If you encounter installation issues,, please refer to the [information pages](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/#macos) of the `sf` library for instructions on how to install these additional libraries.\n:::\n\nOnce downloaded, we can load both files into memory:\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read spatial dataset\nmsoa21 <- st_read(\"data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nReading layer `London-MSOA-2021' from data source \n  `/Users/justinvandijk/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/UCL/Web/jtvandijk.github.io/GEOG0030/data/spatial/London-MSOA-2021.gpkg' \n  using driver `GPKG'\nSimple feature collection with 1002 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 503574.2 ymin: 155850.8 xmax: 561956.7 ymax: 200933.6\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load attribute dataset\nmsoa_eur <- read_csv(\"data/attributes/London-MSOA-European.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 1002 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): msoa21cd\ndbl (2): eur21, pop21\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# inspect\nhead(msoa21)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 530966.7 ymin: 180512.6 xmax: 551943.8 ymax: 191139\nProjected CRS: OSGB36 / British National Grid\n   msoa21cd                 msoa21nm msoa21nmw  bng_e  bng_n      lat      long\n1 E02000001       City of London 001           532384 181355 51.51562 -0.093490\n2 E02000002 Barking and Dagenham 001           548267 189685 51.58652  0.138756\n3 E02000003 Barking and Dagenham 002           548259 188520 51.57606  0.138149\n4 E02000004 Barking and Dagenham 003           551004 186412 51.55639  0.176828\n5 E02000005 Barking and Dagenham 004           548733 186824 51.56069  0.144267\n6 E02000007 Barking and Dagenham 006           549698 186609 51.55851  0.158087\n                                globalid                           geom\n1 {71249043-B176-4306-BA6C-D1A993B1B741} MULTIPOLYGON (((532135.1 18...\n2 {997A80A8-0EBE-461C-91EB-3E4122571A6E} MULTIPOLYGON (((548881.6 19...\n3 {62DED9D9-F53A-454D-AF35-04404D9DBE9B} MULTIPOLYGON (((549102.4 18...\n4 {511181CD-E71F-4C63-81EE-E8E76744A627} MULTIPOLYGON (((551550.1 18...\n5 {B0C823EB-69E0-4AE7-9E1C-37715CF3FE87} MULTIPOLYGON (((549099.6 18...\n6 {A33C6ADD-D70A-4737-ADE5-3460D7016CA1} MULTIPOLYGON (((549819.9 18...\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# inspect\nhead(msoa_eur)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  msoa21cd  eur21 pop21\n  <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>\n1 E02000001  1926  8582\n2 E02000002  1102  8280\n3 E02000003  1930 11542\n4 E02000004   808  6640\n5 E02000005  1541 11082\n6 E02000007  1365 10159\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nYou can further inspect both objects using the `View()` function. \n:::\n\n### Exploring spatial data\nThe first thing we want to do when we load spatial data is to plot the data to check whether everything is in order.

Before proceeding with the join, we need to verify that a matching unique identifier exists in both datasets.

We can quickly sort both columns and have a peek at the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# inspect spatial dataset\nhead(sort(msoa21$msoa21cd))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"E02000001\" \"E02000002\" \"E02000003\" \"E02000004\" \"E02000005\" \"E02000007\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# inspect attribute dataset\nhead(sort(msoa_eur$msoa21cd))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"E02000001\" \"E02000002\" \"E02000003\" \"E02000004\" \"E02000005\" \"E02000007\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThey seem to contain similar values, so that is promising. Let us try to join the attribute data onto the spatial data:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# join attribute data onto spatial data\nmsoa21 <- msoa21 |> \n  left_join(msoa_eur, by = c('msoa21cd' = 'msoa21cd'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe code above uses a pipe function: `|>`. The pipe operator allows you to pass the output of one function directly into the next, streamlining your code.

In this case we did not expect any missing values, so this confirms that all our full attribute dataset has been linked to the spatial dataset. \n\nWe are almost ready to map the data. Only thing that is left is for us to calculate the share of European-born immigrants within each MSOA:\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# calculate proportion\nmsoa21 <- msoa21 |>\n    mutate(prop_eur21 = eur21/pop21)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Mapping spatial data\nFor our map-making, we will use one of the two primary visualisation libraries for spatial data: `tmap.` `tmap` offers a flexible, layer-based approach that makes it easy to create various types of thematic maps, such as choropleths and proportional symbol maps. One of the standout features of `tmap` is its quick plotting function, `qtm()`, which allows you to generate basic maps with minimal effort.\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# quick thematic map\nqtm(msoa21, fill = \"prop_eur21\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Quick thematic map.](01-spatial_files/figure-html/fig-01-qtm-1.png){#fig-01-qtm width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this case, the `fill()` argument in `tmap` is how we instruct the library to create a choropleth map based on the values in the specified column. If we set `fill()` to `NULL`, only the borders of our polygons will be drawn, without any colour fill. The `qtm()` function in `tmap` is versatile, allowing us to pass various parameters to customise the aesthetics of our map. By checking the function's documentation, you can explore the full list of available parameters. For instance, to set the MSOA borders to white, we can use the `borders` parameter:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# quick thematic map\nqtm(msoa21, fill = \"prop_eur21\", borders = \"white\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Quick thematic map with white borders.](01-spatial_files/figure-html/fig-01-qtm-borders-1.png){#fig-01-qtm-borders width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe map does not look quite right yet. While we can continue tweaking parameters in the `qtm()` function to improve it, `qtm()` is somewhat limited in its functionality and is primarily intended for quickly inspecting your data and creating basic maps. For more complex and refined map-making with the `tmap` library, it is better to use the main plotting method that starts with the `tm_shape()` function. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe primary approach to creating maps in `tmap` involves using a [layered grammar of graphics](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149) to build up your map, starting with the `tm_shape()` function. This function, when provided with a spatial dataframe, captures the spatial information of your data, including its projection and geometry, and creates a spatial object. While you can override certain aspects of the spatial data (such as its projection) using the function's parameters, the essential role of `tm_shape()` is to instruct R to \"use this object as the basis for drawing the shapes.\" \n\nTo actually render the shapes, you need to add a layer that specifies the type of shape you want R to draw from this spatial information—such as polygons for our data. This layer function tells R to \"draw my spatial object as `X`\", where `X` represents the type of shape. Within this layer, you can also provide additional details to control how R draws your shapes. Further, you can add more layers to include other spatial objects and their corresponding shapes on your map. Finally, layout options can be specified through a layout layer, allowing you to customise the overall appearance and arrangement of your map.\n:::\n\nLet us build a map using `tmap`:\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# shape, polygons\ntm_shape(msoa21) + tm_polygons()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Building up a map layer by layer.](01-spatial_files/figure-html/fig-01-choro-0-1.png){#fig-01-choro-0 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can now see, we have mapped the spatial polygons of our `msoa21` spatial dataframe. However, this is not quite the map we want; we need a choropleth map where the polygons are coloured based on the proportion of European immigrants. To achieve this, we use the `col` parameter within the `tm_polygons()` function.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThe `col` parameter within `tm_polygons()` allows you to fill polygons with colours based on:\n\n- A single colour value (e.g. `red` or `#fc9272`).\n- The name of a data variable within the spatial data file. This variable can either contain specific colour values or numeric/categorical values that will be mapped to a colour palette.\n:::\n\nLet us go ahead and pass our `prop_eur21` variable within the `col()` parameter and see what we get:\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# shape, polygons\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n  # specify column\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"prop_eur21\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Building up a map layer by layer.](01-spatial_files/figure-html/fig-01-choro-1-1.png){#fig-01-choro-1 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe are making progress, but there are two immediate issues with our map. First, the classification breaks do not adequately reflect the variation in our dataset. By default, `tmap` uses *pretty* breaks, which may not be the most effective for our data. An alternative, such as *natural breaks* (or *jenks*), might better reveal the data's variation.\n\nTo customise the classification breaks, refer to the `tm_polygons()` documentation. The following parameters are relevant:\n\n| Parameter  | Description |\n| :-         | :------ |\n| `n`        | Specifies the number of classification breaks. |\n| `style`    | Defines the method for classification breaks, such as fixed, standard deviation, equal, or quantile. |\n| `breaks`   | Allows you to set specific numeric breaks when using the fixed style. |\n\nFor example, if we want to adjust our choropleth map to use five classes determined by the natural breaks method, we need to add the `n` and `style` parameters to our `tm_polygons()` layer:\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R code'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# shape, polygons\ntm_shape(msoa21) +\n  # specify column, classes\n  tm_polygons(\n    col = \"prop_eur21\",\n    n = 5,\n    style = \"jenks\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Building up a map layer by layer.](01-spatial_files/figure-html/fig-01-choro-2-1.png){#fig-01-choro-2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Styling spatial data\nStyling a map in `tmap` requires a deeper understanding and familiarity with the library, which is something you will develop best through hands-on practice. Here are the key functions to be aware of:\n\n| Function          | Description |\n| :-                | :------ |\n| `tm_layout()`     | Customise titles, fonts, legends, and other layout elements. |\n| `tm_compass()`    | Add and style a North arrow or compass. |\n| `tm_scale_bar()`  | Add and style a scale bar. |\n\nTo begin styling your map, explore each of these functions and their parameters.

The datasets include:\n    * A `csv` file containing the number of people residing in Wales that are born in a European country, as recorded in the 2021 Census for England and Wales, aggregated at the MSOA level.\n    * A `GeoPackage` file containing the 2021 MSOA spatial boundaries for England and Wales.\n2. Load both datasets and merge them together. Make sure to only retain those MSOAs that belong to Wales.\n3. Create a map that shows the proportion of the population residing in Wales that is born in Europe.\n4. Experiment by adjusting various map parameters, such as the colour scheme, map labels, and data classification method.\n\n| File                                            | Type   | Link |\n| :------                                         | :------| :------ |\n| Wales MSOA Census 2021 European Population      | `csv` | [Download](https://github.com/jtvandijk/GEOG0030/tree/master/data/attributes/Wales-MSOA-European.csv) |\n| England and Wales MSOA 2021 Spatial Boundaries  | `GeoPackage` | [Download](https://github.com/jtvandijk/GEOG0030/raw/refs/heads/main/data/spatial/England-Wales-MSOA-2021.gpkg) |\n\n## Before you leave\nAnd that is how you use R as a GIS in its most basic form.
