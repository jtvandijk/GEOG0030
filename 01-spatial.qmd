# Programming for Spatial Analysis

::: {.callout-warning}
For Linux and macOS users who are new to working with spatial data in R, this installation of some of these libraries may fail since additional (non-R) libraries are required (which are automatically installed for Windows users). If this is the case, please refer to the [information pages](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/#macos) of the `sf` library for instructions on how to install these additional libraries.
