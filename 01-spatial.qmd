This week, we will start easy with a refresher on how to use R and RStudio for working with quantitative data. We will revisit some key concepts introduced in [Geography in the Field I](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/geography-in-the-field-1-GEOG0013) and [Geography in the Field II](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/geography-in-the-field-2-GEOG0014), but from next week we will build on these foundations by introducing more advanced statistical techniques.

For Linux and macOS users who are new to working with spatial data in R, this installation of some of these libraries may fail since additional (non-R) libraries are required (which are automatically installed for Windows users). If this is the case, please refer to the [information pages](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/#macos) of the `sf` library for instructions on how to install these additional libraries.
